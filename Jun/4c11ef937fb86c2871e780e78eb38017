  According to Warri Aproko Special, Chikason and Helen have had a secret love affair for long and the wife was said to have initially dismissed it when she heard about it probably because of the trust she had for her husband.

The suspicion of their secret affair grew after the accident. "Problem started when the prophet's first wife, Praise Chikason gave birth to their third daughter as he was expecting a male child.
