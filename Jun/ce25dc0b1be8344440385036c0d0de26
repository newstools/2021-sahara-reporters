A former Communications Director at the Ghanaian Presidency, Koku Anyidoho, has revealed that the late President of the country, John Evans Fiifi Atta Mills was scheduled to travel to Nigeria to meet his spiritual ‘father’, the late Prophet TB Joshua on the day he died dramatically. Mills died on 24 July, 2012 at the 37 Military Hospital in Accra, three days after his 68th birthday. TB Joshua Speaking in an interview on Angel FM monitored on Tuesday, Anyidoho said Mills who served as President of Ghana from 2009 until his death in 2012 had trust in the popular televangelist with whom he had a close relationship. “They had a quite close relationship. I know for a fact that on the 24th of July he died, plans were afoot he was going to travel to Lagos that day. In fact, a letter had been written by his Secretary notifying the Speaker of Parliament of his travel as stipulated by the Constitution before what happened in a very dramatic fashion. “As at 10am, we were all at the Castle and we knew the President was getting ready to travel that afternoon then within seconds and minutes everything suddenly went haywire and it was unbelievable. One moment the person is alive and he’s getting ready to go to Lagos and then shortly he’s no more,” he said. The late Nigerian Prophet also died on Saturday evening, June 5, 2021 shortly after concluding a programme at his church. Joshua reigned for several decades as a fiery preacher on television, using his platform to attract a large number of Christians from across the world. Emmanuel TV, run by Joshua’s SCOAN, is one of Nigeria’s largest Christian broadcast stations, available worldwide via digital and terrestrial switches. In 2014, his church was at the center of a multi-national investigation following a section of his church headquarters in Lagos collapsed, leaving dozens killed and many more injured. Joshua denied allegations of negligence and a trial over the incident was still underway prior to his demise.
