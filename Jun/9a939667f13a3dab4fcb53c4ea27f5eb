The demonstration, which was tagged, ‘Enough is Enough’, lasted for several hours as youths carried placards with inscriptions such as, ‘No to Exploitation and Multiple Taxation’, ‘Provide Jobs or Unemployment Benefits for Youths’, ‘Provide Security in Schools’, ‘End Kidnapping and Banditry’ and ‘Stop Killings, Secure Nigeria’.  The protesters, which included trade unions, civil society, students, farmers, and peasants, were led by a foremost activist, Jaye Gaskiya.  Gaskiya said the protest was organised to express displeasure over how badly the country had degenerated. He expressed worry that Nigeria, characterised by extreme poverty, arms proliferation, religious intolerance, the rise of hate, and ethnic nationalism is moving towards social upheavals due to exploitation of the people, greed, and avarice of a spineless political class that has reached its wit’s end.
