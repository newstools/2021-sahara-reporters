Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju Omiyinka popularly known as Baba Ijesha will be arraigned at an Ikeja Special Offences Court on Thursday over allegations of sexual assault of a minor. The embattled actor has been in custody since his arrest on April 22 for allegedly molesting a minor twice.  The minor is the foster child of a popular comedian, known as Princess. According to a NAN report, Baba Ijesha is to stand trial before Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo on June 24. It was stated that the case is listed on the cause list of the court. The actor was earlier arraigned on June 16 at a Yaba Magistrates’ Court on charges of indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a child, sexual assault by penetration, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault. He pleaded not guilty to the charges but was remanded in custody by P. E. Nwaka, who held that the court could not grant the actor bail because the matter was beyond its jurisdiction. The judge also explained that the case had already been filed before the high court. Nwaka, in that ruling, said, ”I have carefully considered the application of the counsel to the defendant seeking bail for the defendant and the opposition by the counsel from the DPP. “Since there are indications that the matter is before the high court and the defendant will appear before the court, no bail can be given. “The defendant must be accorded full medical attention by the authorities pending his arraignment at the High Court.”
