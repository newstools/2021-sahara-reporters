The General Overseer of the Omega Fire Ministries International, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has warned Nigerian Government over its constant attacks on members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), noting that they might not have people in power but they have God. The Christian leader, who took to his Twitter page on Friday stated this, warning the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to tread with caution.  He pointed out that the military goes after IPOB members and leaves Fulani herdsmen to kill and maim people. Suleman also noted that IPOB's agenda is to pull out a part of Nigeria, unlike killer herdsmen who seek to destroy the whole of Nigeria.His tweet read, “You will go after IPOB? Yet you can't go after killer herdsmen? IPOB seeks to pull out of a part of Nigeria. Killer herdsmen destroy the whole of Nigeria. Who should be dealt with urgently?“Tread with caution sir. They might have no one in power to speak for them, they have GOD.”Suleman is one of Nigeria's clerics who lend their voices to national issues. Suleman recently took a swipe at the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government over its reaction to Twitter's deletion of Buhari's tweet considered to be 'genocidal'. He condemned the move by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed after the latter organised a press conference over the issue. Suleman noted that there were weightier matters that required a press conference. He said, ”Schoolchildren were kidnapped, no federal press conference addressed it. People are killed daily, no word of stern threat to the bandits. A tweet was deleted and you had a press conference? Define joblessness! Many are mad (mentally ill), few are roaming.”
