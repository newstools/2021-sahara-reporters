A 9-year-old girl, Hauwa has been raped by an alleged older relative and in the process left unconscious with damaged anus and private parts. The name of the criminal who happened to be a relative has not been revealed, but the incident occurred in Kaduna State, from the information gathered by SaharaReporters. The incident was revealed by a Twitter user Bimbo Oke of Demi Care Foundation  (@bimbo_cash).  In the video, Hauwa was unconscious as a female health worker wearing hijab attended to her saying, “The private parts are already…Sad! You cannot even differentiate between the front and the back.” The manager of the KBK Foundation, Mr Seyi Odewale told SaharaReporters on Monday that the girl needs money for surgery while lamenting that the rapist was on the run. He said some internal organs of the girl were badly affected, but that efforts were ongoing to arrest the perpetrator, who has disappeared into thin air. “This is heartbreaking! Nine-year-old Hauwa raped and left unconscious in this state. Her privates and anus mangled, she can’t move or talk. Other internal organs affected also. The beast, a relative is said to be on the run,” the initial tweet read.  This is heartbreaking! ,9 year old Hauwa raped and left unconscious in this state .
