Female Nigerian singers, Tiwa Savage and Seyi Shay have been involved in a fight in a salon in Lagos. It was gathered that they clashed over Seyi Shay and Victoria Kimani’s verse on Kizz Daniel’s ‘F**k you’ cover challenge.  In a video trending online, the stars were seen being pulled apart from getting physical at the salon as they threw altercations at each other. Seyi Shay had walked up to Tiwa Savage at the salon to say hi, but Tiwa said she had no right to walk up to her to say hi, considering what she and Victoria Kimani had done to her in the past. Tiwa Savage went further by saying God should take her son’s life if she ever said anything bad about Seyi Shay and Victoria Kimani. She described Seyi Shay as a whore, whose ‘yansh’ is the dirtiest in the Nigerian music industry. Seyi Shay replied saying, “Stop acting like an agbaya. You’re a dog.”  WATCH: Nigerian Female Artists, Tiwa Savage, Seyi Shay Fight Dirty In Lagosð¥: Tunde Ednut pic.twitter.com/8hFoDJdKEf  Seyi Shay and Victoria Kimani had in 2019 released their covers of Kizz Daniel’s hit song, ‘F**k You’, where they had both dissed Tiwa Savage.
