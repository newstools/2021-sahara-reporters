A yet-to-be-identified eight-year-old girl has reportedly died after she was involved in an accident on Friday, June 18, 2021, in Ajah, Lagos State. An eyewitness identified as Joy informed SaharaReporters that the girl was trying to cross the road when a reckless bus driver knocked her down.  She alleged that the girl died due to negligence by medical personnel at the hospital where she was taken. She added that immediately the little girl was knocked down, she (Joy), her friends, and a few other persons rushed her to nearby Doren Specialist Hospital located at Thomas Village Estate, along Lagos-Epe Expressway, Ajah, where she was immediately declared dead by a female medic at the hospital. The doctor allegedly placed only a stethoscope on the chest of the victim without trying any other emergency medical procedure. Joy, who is a graduate of Nursing, lamented that she advised the doctor to carry out a Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, CPR, on the little girl but the medical expert ignored, insisting that she was dead. She said she backed down when the doctor put up an argument with her. CPR is an emergency lifesaving procedure that is done when someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. Joy lamented the situation in a video she posted on her Twitter page.  Efforts to reach the father of the child were unsuccessful as he failed to send necessary details about the incident as promised.
