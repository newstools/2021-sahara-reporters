Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu says the unity among Nigerians against the oppressive and autocratic rule of President Muhammadu Buhari makes him happy. He said Nigerian government and its security agents have decided to vent unnecessary anger on the people of the South-East, but he was happy that citizens of the country joined the Igbo in condemning their atrocities of the leaders. Nnamdi Kanu The IPOB leader said he was elated as Nigerian people rose to tackle the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami on his comparison of spare parts dealing to open grazing farming. He added that the way people stood up against the genocidal war threats against Igbo youths by Buhari gave him an impression that Nigerians are united to restrict despotic traits of the President. Kanu disclosed this in an audio interview he granted on Thursday night. “Igbos are the most widely travelled people you know. We can’t be angry because we also go out everywhere. So, when you see this kind of personalisation of the angst, so what it tells us is something. With all due respect, that’s what every Igbo feels including myself. That somehow when there is a big problem in Nigeria, if you need to resolve it, use Igbo head to resolve that problem. “Let me tell you one thing that I’m very happy about and that is when the Minister of Justice made the unfortunate statement about the spare parts trader, you could see everyone came out to say I’m a spare parts dealer too. And that gladdens everybody. When Mr President also made the unfortunate statement about genocide, you could see all Nigerians came out to say that I am Igbo. “That is to say, we have transcended the artificial boundaries they used before to demonise a particular group of people. We are happy that Nigerians are all coming together. Nigerians are all seeing what is here is not Igbo problem, what we have is syndicate going around killing people,” Kanu said.
