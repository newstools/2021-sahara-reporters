Odah said the suspects were arrested during operations on Monday to disperse hoodlums enforcing the sit-at-home order by IPOB.  According to her, the police neutralised three suspected armed robbers, recovered three expended cartridges, a jackknife, an axe, a cutlass and some charms from them.  She explained that following a distress call that some hoodlums had barricaded Ogbaga road, attacking and setting vehicles ablaze, operatives were swiftly deployed to the scene.  “The hoodlums on sighting the police opened fire.  “In the exchange of gun battle that ensued, two members of the gang were fatally wounded while others escaped with bullet wounds into the nearby bush,” said the statement.  Odah said one locally-made shotgun, one locally-made revolver pistol with five live cartridges, one jack knife, one axe and some charms were recovered from them.  “A Toyota Picnic was set ablaze by the gang, including five motorcycles of different brands.  “Innocent citizens were attacked because they refused to obey the ‘sit-at-home’ directive of the IPOB.  “The traumatised victims are currently responding to treatment at Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital,” she said.  Odah explained that two of the IPOB suspects on a surveillance mission were intercepted in front of the police headquarters in the state.  “One locally made double barrel shotgun with four cartridges was recovered from them,” Odah said.
