President Muhammadu Buhari says he will go back to his cows and continue farming after leaving office in 2023. Buhari disclosed that he still kept a farm and "have some cattle" that will keep him busy after his presidency. "I have never abandoned my farm, and I still have many cattle," he told ARISE TV in an interview. "When I leave, I will go to my farm daily and try to keep myself busy." He added, “Between now and then, I will try to keep on convincing Nigerians that I mean very well. I will make sure that they see identifiable problems. We have situated the economy in fighting them, and we will continue to anchor it." "Visibly, we made progress in the North-East. We made progress in the South-South. I am overwhelmed almost by North-West, and they are going to get it very soon," he stated. When asked by the TV station what his legacy would be, the president said Nigerians should discuss it because he would not like to state his legacy himself. "I will allow Nigerians to discuss it," he said, “I wouldn't like to say it myself. I hope Nigerians will be fair to me. That's all I need."
