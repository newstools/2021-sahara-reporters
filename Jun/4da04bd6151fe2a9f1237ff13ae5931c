9 Hours Ago Many Lagos residents were however unhappy with it as they were stuck in traffic for hours. As the police IG’s convoy passed the blocked road, the crowd booed and called him names in Yoruba. Some shouted “thief”, others screamed “you will never do well”. The IGP’s visit comes three days to the June 12 nationwide protests that have been planned to take place at Freedom Park, Ojota. The protests, being championed by civil society organisations and human rights activists, are to kick against bad governance under the President Muhammadu Buhari regime and his anti-democratic ways.
