The Nigerian government says Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other social media giants must register in the country. Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture, made the disclosure to state house correspondents after the meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Wednesday.  Mohammed added that the management of Twitter has reached out for a “high-level discussion” to resolve the issue that led to the suspension of its operations in Nigeria. The Minister insisted that Twitter was suspended because it provided a platform for people threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria. He said freedom of speech was not stifled by the action, adding that Nigerians can still use other platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. He added that Twitter’s loss of money as a result of the suspension is an indication of its effectiveness. Mohammed claimed that the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, helped to fund last year’s #EndSARS protest and is also allowing the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to use the medium to call for the killing of Nigerian security operatives. He then made it clear that one of the conditions that must be met before the Nigerian government lifts the suspension on Twitter, is that the social media firm must be registered in Nigeria as a business concern. Mohammed said other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram must also be registered in the country.
