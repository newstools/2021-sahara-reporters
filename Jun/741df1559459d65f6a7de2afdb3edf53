Leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has said nothing will stop the independence of the proposed Oduduwa and Biafra republics. He stated this in a tweet on Thursday while reacting to a report that claimed the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, accused him and Yoruba agitator, Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho) of fuelling the crisis in the country. IPOB Leader, Nnamdi Kanu Kanu tweeted, “In the document, Mr Malami blamed Nnamdi Kanu & Sunday Igboho for fuelling the protracted crisis that has enveloped the country and aggravated the social and economic conditions of Nigerians’. Anyway, your Martial Law won’t stop #Biafra & #Oduduwa.” The report, published by Peoples Gazette, had stated that the Attorney General, Abubakar Malami advised President Muhammadu Buhari to move swiftly to suspend the fundamental rights of all Nigerians as guaranteed under Chapter IV of the Constitution. “Malami told Buhari that insecurity across Nigeria has reached a level that could no longer be checked by existing democratic techniques, saying only a state of emergency promulgated by the president can help return the country to tranquillity. “In the early pages of the document, Malami cited widespread acts of insecurity and blamed prominent separatist agitators like Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu for fuelling the protracted crisis that has enveloped the country and aggravated the social and economic conditions of Nigerians," the report read.
