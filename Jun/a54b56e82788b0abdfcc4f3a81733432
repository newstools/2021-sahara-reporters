Nigerians have commended the CEO of Microblogging platform, Twitter, Jack Dorsey for deleting President Muhammadu Buhari’s tweet where he threatened to treat Nigerians “misbehaving” in “the language they understand”.  This was contained in the last part of his Twitter thread on Tuesday.  The tweet reads, “Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.”  See Also

0 Comments
4 Hours Ago The President's Twitter account was reported by Nigerians who understood the last part of the thread as threats against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its military wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).  Many reminded Buhari of the consequences of the Nigerian Civil War which lasted from 1967 to 1970, stating that such must not be repeated.  Also, social media users likened President’s statement to that of the former United States President Donald Trump which earned the latter a permanent suspension.  Following widespread condemnation of the tweet, Twitter deleted the message on Wednesday.  The platform said the particular message by the Nigerian President violated its rules.  Nigerians have taken to the platform to applaud Twitter's CEO, Jack for deleting the tweet.  However, the majority stated that the sole action of deleting the tweet is not enough, calling for a temporary ban on the President's Twitter account.  Some noted that the account ought to be permanently banned due to the handler's constant habit of blocking comments.   Thank you @Jack. @MBuhari is a threat to life and property of the people he ought to protect. Please do well to indefinitely delete his account if such tweets from him continue. Who is he that twitter cannot suspend? Let him asked Donald Trump how far...ð Unfortunately, Twitter will not be able to delete the genocidal mindset from his psychic.The 97%-5% comment has always shown his strong aversion for the Igbos coupled with the heavy militarization of a usually peaceful region. I commend @Twitter for deleting @MBuhariâs tweet threatening Civil War 2 on Nigeriaâs SE. It was a most irresponsible tweet and Nigerians are grateful to @Jack for talking that action. But please do not stop there. Delete his account. Buhari is a menace to the world#TableShaker The page should be deleted from Twitter. He will not allow Nigerians comment on his page because he lacks empathy. We were warned! Does it mean they can't suspend his account? If they can suspend that of Trump I see no reason why they shouldn't suspend Buhari's own. Do the needful Twitter, don't go against your rules.
