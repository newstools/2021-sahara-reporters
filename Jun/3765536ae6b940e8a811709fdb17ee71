A letter addressed to the president of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Ayuba Wabba, reads, “I am pleased to invite you on behalf of Interfaith Initiatives for Peace jointly led by the Sultan of Sokoto, his eminence Mohammad Sa’adu Abubakar and his eminence John Cardinal Onaiyekan, national peace committee chaired by general Abdulsalami Abubakar and Socio-cultural Consultative Committee convened by me and all these bodies called Committee of Goodness of Nigeria, CJN,  to an exploratory meeting on pressing issues of national unity, security, peace, integration, economic revitalization and development, women and youth welfare and general progress.” Obasanjo had on Sunday asked Nigerians to cry to God for a solution to the security crisis plaguing the country. He said, “We seem to have been overwhelmed and unsure of how to handle the crisis in our land. But nothing is too difficult for God to do. That is why we are here. “We have some challenges. These are beyond what we can handle. We have to cry out to God to help us.”
