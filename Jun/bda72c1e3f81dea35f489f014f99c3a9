The people of Finima community in Bonny Kingdom have staged a protest against alleged lack of recognition and regard for them as the host community of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (NLNGL). Demanding local content for the host community on Thursday, the protesters were seen singing and dancing, and displaying placards with various messages relating to their agitation.  The protesters also shut down the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (NLNGL) base in Bonny Island.  In January, Bonny residents staged a peaceful protest over attacks by sea pirates, kidnapping and looting.  Bonny Kingdom is the host of multi-billion dollar NLNG. The Island is in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, near Port Harcourt. Ferries are the main form of transport to and from the island.
