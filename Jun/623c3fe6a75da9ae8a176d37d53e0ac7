President Muhammadu Buhari has said that Fulani herdsmen armed with sophisticated weapons to kill people in agrarian communities are not from Nigeria.  The President disclosed that Fulani people look identical and have similar culture, which makes it difficult for people to differentiate them.  Buhari, while speaking during Arise TV programme monitored by SaharaReporters on Thursday, also said he cannot deny being a Fulani.  He, however, insisted that Nigerian herders only bear sticks and machetes to cut grass for their cattle.  “The problem is trying to understand the culture of cattle rearers. There is a culture of the Fulanis. So, the government of Benue said I’m not disciplining the cattle rearers because I’m one of them.  “I cannot refuse to say I’m not one of them but he’s being very unfair to me and I told him that the Nigerian cattle rearers are not carrying anything more than a stick, sometimes a machete to cut trees and give to animals.  “But those with sophisticated weapons, with Ak-47, are from the Sahel area. They are Fulani people from Mauritania, Central Republic Africa. They look the same, so they will think they are Nigerians.  “But, I assure you, we are trying to resuscitate these cattle routes, grazing areas and make them accountable,” Buhari said.
