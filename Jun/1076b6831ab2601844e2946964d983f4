Some Cameroonians living in the United States of America have called for the closure of the country’s embassy in Washington DC over poor services rendered and for failing to serve their interest. They accused the ambassador, Henri Etoundi Essomba and other officials of corruption, ineptitude and negligence.  “They hardly respond to calls or emails sent, all these actions do not justify taxpayers money spent in running the embassy as they rarely perform their task,” a Cameroonian told SaharaReporters. Another citizens of the Central African country described the embassy as the ‘worst in the entire world.’ He said, “It is the worst embassy in the entire world. They do not care about their citizens and as a matter of fact thousands of their citizens in America do not have access to the embassy. “If you call, they never pick. I tried it myself for over 3 days. They were really frustrated about it and I felt it is time to expose the ills of the embassy and the nepotic government in Cameroon. “The ambassador, Henri Etoundi Essomba also discriminates against the English-speaking people of Cameroon.”
