A four-year-old UK-based Nigerian boy simply identified as Isaac has appealed to the Nigerian Government to fix the numerous challenges facing the country. Isaac, in an emotional video on social media, was seen crying profusely with his mother because his white classmates were not usually playing with him in school.  The little boy who appeared to be unhappy about the level of discrimination in school said he was sure that he loves everyone in his school but not sure if such love he extends to them applies to him. Isaac said; "My name is Isaac. I feel good going to school every day. I feel happy with my friends in school but I am not sure they are happy with me because they don't play with me all the time. They don't play with me all the time because I don't have the same skin colour as them. I feel sad about that. "I wish to go to high school in Nigeria because everyone in Nigeria has the same colour as me. I feel connected with them." His mother who didn't mention her name said, "But, you don't have experience of what Nigeria looks like. You know people are saying a lot of bad things about Nigeria. You left Nigeria when you were eighteen months old." His mother who was crying bitterly further said her son used to tell her many terrible things white children were doing to him in school because of his colour. "Do something about Nigeria. We are not happy here. We want to come back home but no social amenities. No school. Fear of insecurity is another problem. Please, do something. How can I take them to the hospital when they are sick? We want to come back home, do something," she cried.
