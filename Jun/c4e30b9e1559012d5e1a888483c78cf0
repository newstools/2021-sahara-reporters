Recall that the population census was last conducted in Nigeria in 2006 and another ought to have been conducted in 2016. NPC boss said the commission would soon suggest the census to President Muhammadu Buhari, once the entire processes were completed. He said, “It is within the purview of the President; we can’t precisely say this is the date. However, we are embarking on pre-census activities. “These are the efforts we are making in view of the fact that census is absolutely necessary. We are on the verge of completing pre census, maybe in the next one year. We will suggest a date to Mr President and we are targeting maybe 2022.”
