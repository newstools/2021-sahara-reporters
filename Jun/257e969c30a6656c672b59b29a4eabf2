The General Overseer of the Omega Fire Ministries International, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has taken a swipe at the Federal Government over its reaction to the deletion of President Muhammadu Buhari's tweet considered to be 'genocidal'. On Wednesday, Twitter deleted a part of a thread posted on Buhari's account, which many interpreted to be hate speech against Igbo people. Apostle Suleman While defending its action, the tech company said the President’s tweet violated its rules. However, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed organised a press conference where he alleged that Twitter's mission in Nigeria is suspicious. The Minister accused Twitter of ignoring inciting tweets by the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, and others, adding that Nigeria would not be fooled. “We have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter’s mission in Nigeria is very suspect, they have an agenda,” he said. But reacting in a tweet on Thursday, Apostle Suleman condemned the minister's move, noting that there were weightier matters that would require a press conference. He said, ”Schoolchildren were kidnapped, no federal press conference addressed it. People are killed daily, no word of stern threat to the bandits. A tweet was deleted and you had a press conference? Define joblessness! Many are mad (mentally ill), few are roaming.”  School children were kidnapped,no federal press conference addressed it.People are killed daily,no word of stern threat to the bandits.A tweet was deleted and you had a press conference?.Define joblessness!!Many are mad,few are roaming..
