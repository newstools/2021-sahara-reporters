A cleric, Prophet Segun Adebayo, has sent warnings to top monarchs, the Alaafin of Oyo in Oyo State, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, and the Ooni of Ife in Osun State, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, saying God showed him in a prophecy that the two monarchs “should be very careful” about their roles in the Yoruba nation agitations. Adebayo stated that the two monarchs were not upright and were betraying the cause of the Yoruba nation’s actualisation, adding that they have to be very careful. Governor Kayode Fayemi The prophet said these in an interview by Asabeafrika.com, obtained by SaharaReporters on Thursday. Speaking in Yoruba, Adebayo said, “Let Alaafin go and be careful. Prophets enthrone kings. If a country is in crisis, it is a prophet God will raise to bring a solution. Let Alaafin go and be very careful. I speak to you, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi. “He should please be careful. God makes a prophet see what they (the monarchs) think people do not see. Let Oba Ogunwusi also be careful. Let him be careful. Let both of them be very careful. The Lord says you both are betraying our cause. Go and be careful.” The prophet also warned the Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, and the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, to be careful with how they govern their states. “Fayemi, governor of Ekiti, go and be careful. You cannot be president. He cannot be president. It is all lies. He should go and be careful. Oyo State governor, go and be careful. God is talking to you; you are not listening. You are not being truthful. There is no truth in what you are doing,” he added. “God told me on the Mountain of Epinmi Akoko that there would be deaths in 2020; a lot of deaths; that was when coronavirus came.”
