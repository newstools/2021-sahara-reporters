One of the governorship aspirants in Anambra State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) primary election, Chief Maduafokwa Olisakwe has asked the party to refund the N26 million he used in purchasing the governorship form. Anambra PDP has been enmeshed in internal wrangling of late, leading to the emergence of two factions of the party.  The party had on Saturday declared Valentine Ozigbo as the winner of the party’s primary election held in Awka on Saturday, June 26, 2021. The former chief executive officer of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria, secured 62 votes to emerge as the candidate of the PDP for the November 6 governorship election in the state. Speaking in a trending video, Olisakwe said he was angry over the conduct of the primary election. He said, “The PDP, I’m telling them will look for my money and all the money I spent. “I am not happy. When I picked up my form which the party forced us to pay N26 million, I am among those who paid and we are sixteen in number. So the journey to this point has been very excruciatingly painful. “You cannot change the rules of the game after the game has started. You change the results or you shift the goal post. The PDP, I’m telling them will look for my money and all the money I spent. “When we filled our forms, we were given delegate list totalling 2,500 but look at, they are bringing in 290.”
