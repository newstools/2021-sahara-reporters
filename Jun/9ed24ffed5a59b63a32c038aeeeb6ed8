A young woman identified as Tamara Daspan has reportedly died from a traumatic brain injury after she was robbed and pushed out of a vehicle by suspected robbers in Jos, the Plateau State capital. The incident occurred on Monday, June 21, 2021.  It was gathered that Tamara was allegedly pushed out of a moving commercial tricycle, popularly called Keke Marwa, by robbers after she had been robbed. This led to the brain injury she sustained from the fall. The graduate of the University of Abuja was immediately rushed to the hospital for proper medical attention. But she later died after brain surgery was carried out on her at the hospital. Details of the incident were still sketchy at the time of writing the report.
