Some unknown gunmen on Monday night stormed the residence of the registrar of the National Examination Council, Godswill Obioma, strangling him to death. According to a report by Peoples Gazette, the wife of the deceased, Elizabeth Obioma said the assailants killed her husband and did not take any valuable from the house.  She was quoted as saying, “The assassins came in and killed him and left without taking anything.” Weeping profusely, Obioma said her husband had just returned to Minna from a trip to Abuja when the armed men, lurking in his compound, descended on him and strangled him. It was gathered that Obioma had been facing attempts to remove him from office as the head of NECO, a prominent examination body run by the Nigerian government. Obioma, 67, was appointed head of NECO barely a year ago on May 14, 2020. He hailed from Abia in Nigeria’s Igbo-dominated South-East region. The incident came barely a day after Ahmed Gulak, a top politician of the ruling All Progressive Congress, was gunned down in Owerri, raising widespread fears of insecurity.
