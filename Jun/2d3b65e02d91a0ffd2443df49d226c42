The Senate lobby of the National Assembly Complex was affected by the heavy rainfall in Abuja on Tuesday morning. It was observed that the Senate Chambers was filled with water with the cleaners battling to clean and control water from flowing into it.  Checks revealed that the entrance of the Senate’s wing of the National Assembly was flooded as a result of a leaking roof. In 2020, an investigation revealed that there was a public outcry against the alleged allocation of N27 billion for the renovation of the National Assembly Complex in Abuja in the 2020 Budget. Director-General of the Budget Office, Ben Akabueze, later clarified that only N9.2 billion was provided for renovation/retrofitting of the National Assembly (NASS) complex in the revised budget as against N27 billion. He further disclosed that “the initial provision of N37bn in the 2020 Appropriation Act for this was cut by 75 percent due to the impact of COVID-19 on government revenues.”
