A High Court sitting at Ring Road, Ibadan in Oyo State has adjourned the case of Adesina Ayobami Ademuyiwa and 10 others that allegedly participated in the #EndSARS protest in October 2020. The matter was adjourned till July 7, 2021.  Meanwhile, the 11 persons have been detained at the Correctional Centre in Oyo since last October, eight months ago. A source said they had told Oyo State Government about the case, but the government insisted that the prosecution is being undertaken by the Federal government. Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore has also been drawing public attention to the case and in a tweet on Wednesday, he said, "There’re 11 #EndSARS protesters imprisoned at the Federal prison in Oyo, these youngsters have languished in prison for about 9 months without reprieve, they were not even produced in court today. "We’ve alerted you to this but your people claim it feds (federal government) prosecuting. Your AGF should take over and discontinue the trial. We can’t wait for these injustices to go on. Let our people go FreeOyo11 Now." SaharaReporters had reported how a lady, Adesina Adekemi, urged Nigerians to help her get back her brother, Ademuyiwa, who was taken away by the Nigeria police eight months ago for participating in the #EndSARS protest.
