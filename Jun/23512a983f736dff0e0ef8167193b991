Security operatives have barricaded the Gani Fawehinmi Park in Ojota, Lagos State, where some residents planned to protest. According to Daily Trust, an Armoured Personnel Carrier is stationed at the entrance of the park while armed officers have mounted strategic places around the place. pulseng The every-busy Ikorodu road is deserted as traders have closed shops while a few vehicles are on the road. Most residents have chosen to stay indoors, apparently to prevent being caught in any clash between security operatives and protesters. Citing the rising insecurity and economic hardship, protesters had fixed June 12, Nigeriaâ€™s Democracy Day, for the protest. But the police have repeatedly warned that protest would not be allowed in any part of the state. Popularly known as Freedom Park, the Gani Fawehinmi Park was where the massive Occupy Nigeria protest held in 2012. It shook the government of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan. Meanwhile, there is normalcy in most parts of Lagos State.
