Posters of the national leader of All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, have flooded parts of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The posters, which carry Tinubu's bold picture and name, surfaced on Sunday strategically pasted on public infrastructures like traffic kiosks, bus stops and other public places in the nation's capital.  The posters were seen at Garki, Central Area, Maitama, Wuse 11 around the APC secretariat and Shehu Shagari way opposite the Ministry of Justice in the FCT on Sunday. The posters also carried inscriptions like "TinubuNe", "Happy Democracy Day", and "Tinubu Advocates Group." The former Lagos state governor is believed to be nursing presidential ambition ahead of the 2023 general elections, although he (Tinubu) has not publicly declared intention despite pressures. A group known as the Disciples of Jagaban, DOJ, a merger of 12 political and socio-cultural groups working towards the actualisation of Tinubu's presidency come 2023, had recently threatened to sue the APC national leader if he fails to declare and contest the 2023 presidential election.
