Federal Secretariat, Ikolaba, Ibadan,Oyo State He stated that one of the staff members said the payment for the form is not official and is not a directive from the federal government, albeit it is being charged and used for administrative purposes. He said, ”Two weeks ago, a friend of mine came to Ibadan, he said he has come to obtain a form at the Federal Secretariat for a job in the National Task Force. I thought it was just a form so I followed him down there to the place. “On getting there, we discovered that they're selling form at N15, 500. We met so many people filling the form at N15, 500, they said it is for recruitment into National Task Force. “I asked the man in charge, he said truly the Federal Government has not asked them to collect money from anybody but they are using the money for administrative works, that it is the money they have collected for the forms they will use if they want to go for a seminar or meeting in Abuja if they want to do anything in the office to buy the files or to print out the form, that that's what the money is for. “I searched online for the National Task Force but I didn't see anything. I asked questions again and the man told us the Federal government has established National Task Force since 10 years ago but they haven't been able to inaugurate it and that very soon, they will inaugurate it. “The form is for those who want to be employed into the National Task Force, they have to pay for it. Once you pay the N15, 500, they open a file for you immediately. These officials have made a lot of money from this.”
