The suspension of the microblogging platform, Twitter has been described as another embarrassing trend in the fascist posture of the President Muhammadu Buhari regime, by the African Action Congress (AAC). This was disclosed on Friday in a statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the Party, Femi Adeyeye.  AAC said it's an exaggerated foolishness to seek to trample on people’s digital rights, noting that the Buhari regime is seeking to break its own poor record of press and media rights violations. "It’s actually exaggerated foolishness to seek to trample on people’s digital rights in this age of digitization. "What is more embarrassing in the events that have played out in recent times is that while governments of other countries are working to position better on the global ranking of press freedom, the Buhari regime is seeking to break its own poor record of press and media rights violations.
