The Benue State Government has declared Thursdays and Fridays as work-free days for workers in the state to be able to engage in farming activities till the end of July 2021. The government of Benue State is repeating this action of granting work-free days for workers during the planting and harvest season, but this is the first time the work-free days will be two days a week.  This notification was contained in a memo signed by Samuel Udeh on behalf of the Head of Service, Veronica Onyeke titled, ‘Declaration of work-free days for public servants in the state to enhance farming to develop agricultural value chain in Benue State’. It indicated that state governor, Samuel Ortom had approved Thursdays and Fridays work-free days. “Accordingly, effective from Thursday, 17th June to 30th July 2021, Thursdays and Fridays have been declared as work-free days. Civil servants are hereby advised to take advantage of these days to engage in farming and other agricultural-related activities," part of the memo read. The memo, however, stated that workers on essential services were exempted from the work-free days.
