Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, has asked security operatives to stay alert and resist attacks of bandits ravaging the state and take the fight to them. The governor urged the policemen not to spare any bandits and other criminals in the fight against insecurity.  Uzodimma, who spoke while on a condolence visit to the headquarters of the State Police Command in Owerri on Tuesday, asked policemen to go after the bandits before they get to them. He said, “You are the only ones constitutionally empowered to carry a gun. And then you allow somebody called bandit who is not licensed to carry a gun to come to your station and kill you. Kill them before they come near to kill you.” Uzodimma also promised that his administration would introduce an insurance policy for all the security operatives serving in the state. The governor disclosed that his government was arranging a welfare package to compensate all the family members of those who died during the chaos in the state. He also praised the state police commissioner, Abutu Yaro, for improving the security situation in the state in the past six weeks and gifted the command six operational vehicles. According to the police commissioner, Uzodimma is the only governor to have paid the police such a condolence visit.
