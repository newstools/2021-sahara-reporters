Lawmakers of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the National Assembly have opened a Twitter account in defiance of the microblogging platform ban by the Muhammadu Buhari-led government. This comes a few hours after members of the party in the House of Representatives staged a walkout over the action of the Nigerian government.  The lawmakers on Tuesday staged the walkout after its caucus leader Kingsley Chinda was ruled out of order by Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila. Chinda had prayed the House to urge the Federal Government to suspend the ban while the house conducts its investigation into the legality of the ban. Chinda noted that the implication is that the ban would remain for 10 days and the rights of Nigerians would be kept in abeyance during the period of investigation. The Speaker, however, cited part of the Standing Orders of the House stating that a matter that had been concluded by the parliament cannot be revisited for a debate. The Speaker, therefore, ruled the lawmaker out of order, a decision that did not go down well with some members of the opposition who walked out of plenary. Chinda also insisted that members of the PDP caucus in the House will continue to tweet in disregard to the ban. Some other members kept shouting “continue to tweet, “continue to tweet”. SaharaReporters gathered on Wednesday that a new Twitter account, @9thPDPCaucus has been opened by the lawmakers. Nigeria’s information and culture minister Lai Mohammed had last Friday announced Twitter’s suspension in a statement by his media aide, Segun Adeyemi. The suspension by the Nigerian government comes days after a post by President Buhari on the 1967 civil war was deleted by the microblogging platform. The Nigerian government’s spokesman cited “the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence” as the reason for the suspension.
