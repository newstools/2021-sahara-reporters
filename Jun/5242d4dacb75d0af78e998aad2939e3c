Some aggrieved staff members of Santana Security Agency, a company hired by Chevron Nigeria Limited in 2016 have accused their employer of forcing them to work without pay. The private security officers who claimed to be working under slavish conditions alleged that they were being owned salaries running to five months.  They called on the management of Chevron and well-meaning Nigerians to intervene. “We’re working with Chevron Nigeria Limited as contract security staff but we are being short-changed heavily from salaries, emoluments, incentives to other duly enshrined welfare packages we ought to be entitled to,” one of them told SaharaReporters. Another staff member said they were forced to work during COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 without any special allowance. “Our company promised us N55,000 but we are being paid N46,000. We were forced to be contributing N2,000 monthly as Christmas bonus but we were not given. Till date, it’s still being deducted from us. “Santana Security Agency was hired by Chevron Nigeria Limited on 1st of August, 2016 but till date, our pension has only be paid to our pension accounts for just 26 months. “We worked throughout the COVID-19 era till date, yet no allowance. People we are attending to whom are on quarantine are being paid N10,000 and above daily while on quarantine but for us, nothing till date. “We are paying tax yet no receipt to that effect. I haven’t seen any insurance form given to anyone, yet we are being forced to pay N3,000 monthly.”
