The Baale (traditional chief) of Araromi, Bakatari, a border town in the Ido Local Government Area of Oyo state, Chief Tafa Apanpa and his wife were kidnapped on Tuesday evening. A source who hails from the village, Kunle Alausa confirmed the incident to SaharaReporters in Ibadan on Wednesday.  The source said the gunmen stormed the village around 9pm on Tuesday. Our correspondent learnt that the gunmen came into the town with about 5 motorbikes and went straight to Baale's house. According to our source, some hunters have gone into the forest in search of the Baale and his wife. Alausa appealed to the state government to rescue the traditional chief. He said, "I am on my way to the village now. They called me around 11pm to brief me about the abduction of our father and the Baale of our village, Chief Tafa Apanpa. I learnt they (kidnappers) arrived in the village while it was raining on Tuesday night. "The time was around 9pm. People have been moving out of the village as I was told. But being an indegene of the village, I am already on my way to the village. I also learnt hunters in the area have moved to the forest to see if they could get them rescued unhurt. "We want the government to kindly come to our rescue. We cannot do it alone. When they are kidnapping traditional chiefs, who else cannot be kidnapped?"
