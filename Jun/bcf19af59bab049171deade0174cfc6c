Religious war is coming and it will be very severe and have widespread effects in several states. “Tribal war will happen and tribes will rise against another. The Yoruba will not be united; likewise, the Igbo people will not be united that is what will lead to misunderstanding. “There will be a lack of unity between the Arewa and the Fulani people. These misunderstandings will bring out statements that will lead to a religious war. “People should pray against misunderstanding that can lead to religious and tribal wars that can destroy great things.”
