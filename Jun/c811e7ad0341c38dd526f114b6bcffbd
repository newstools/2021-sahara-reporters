The Onion Producers and Marketers Association of Nigeria, OPMAN, said it's members have lost N4.5 billion to various crises in southern Nigeria. OPMAN has therefore vowed to cut off supply of the commodity to southern Nigeria from Monday, June 7, 2021.  The group said it would halt the move if authorities meet the associationâ€™s demands. The association addressed journalists in Sokoto on Saturday, saying it's members have lost onions and property worth N4.5 billion in various crises in southern Nigeria. President of OPMAN, Aliyu Isa, said members of the association who suffered losses due to ethno-religous crises must be compensated, identifying it as one of their demands. "Our members have lost onions and property worth N4.5 billion in various crises in the South," he said. He said, "During the Aba crisis in Abia State, the association lost three members, while about 30 trailers, 9 utility cars, 50 stores and 10,000 bags of onion, among other valuables belonging to our members, were destroyed. "In Shasa, Oyo State, he said 27 lives, five trailers, 5,600 bag of Onions, 12 utility vehicles and other valuables were lost. "Our members were robbed of onions worth N13 million in Imo State recently. "After full deliberation by the executive members of this association and the failure of government to respond to our cry, we resolved that we are shutting down the supply of onions to the entire South by Monday, June 7, 2021, unless all our demands are met."
