The King of Arigidi Akoko, Oba Yisa Olanipekun, has said the remains of popular Nigerian televangelist, Temitope Balogun Joshua, also known as Prophet TB Joshua should be buried in his hometown, Arigidi Akoko, in Ondo State. The monarch on Monday explained that other clerics including Prophet Moses Orimolade were buried in his Ikare hometown. He stressed that Prophet TB Joshua is treasured in his hometown and that he must be buried in Arigidi Akoko.  The monarch said that TB Joshua philanthropic legacy will remain in the hearts of the people if he is buried in Arigidi, noting that the founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) touched persons living in every nook and cranny of Akoko land. "My greatest regret was that TB Joshua could not complete the university project in Arigidi," the king said. “He would bring rice to the people whenever we requested. He hated to see people go hungry. He was instrumental to the electrification of many communities in Akoko land after years of darkness,” he added. People have since been mourning him, with loyalists and friends paying condolence visits to his hometown in Arigidi-Akoko Ondo State, where a picture frame of Joshua was placed outside with a condolence register.
