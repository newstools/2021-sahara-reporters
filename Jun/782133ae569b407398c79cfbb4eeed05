Despite the statement made by Nigerian government that he was arrested on Sunday, June 27, 2021, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu posted on Twitter on Monday, June 28 and Sunday afternoon. The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) on Tuesday announced that Kanu was intercepted by operatives of Nigeria's security intelligence on Sunday but failed to disclose the location.  He is facing charges bordering on treasonable felony instituted against him at the Federal High Court in Abuja in response to years of campaign for the independent Republic of Biafra through IPOB. Kanu was granted bail in April 2017 for health reasons but jumped bail after flouting some of the conditions given to him by the court. Speaking on why he escaped from Nigeria on Tuesday, the IPOB leader said his house was unlawfully invaded by security men with his life seriously threatened. The Biafran leader further alleged that he would have been killed along with others on the day of the invasion if not for the wisdom he applied to flee the country. A check by SaharaReporters on the Kanu’s Twitter account showed it was active on Sunday and Monday. Below are the last two tweets by the arrested IPOB leader;  NEWS: "ISWAP, Boko Haram Kill Soldiers As Terrorists Overrun Nigerian Army Base". #ZooMeanwhile, in Biafraland Nigerian soldiers are busy killing & abducting Biafrans in their homes. COWARDS in uniform. We will continue to defend Biafraland against these terrorists in uniform. pic.twitter.com/ba6TqKT9Pd   NEWS: "ISWAP, Boko Haram Kill Soldiers As Terrorists Overrun Nigerian Army Base". #ZooMeanwhile, in Biafraland Nigerian soldiers are busy killing & abducting Biafrans in their homes.
