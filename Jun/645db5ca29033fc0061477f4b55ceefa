A female corps member, simply identified as Ijeoma has died in the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) camp in Katsina State, where the corps members for Borno State have their orientation camp. SaharaReporters gathered that the corps member, a pharmacist died due to lack of medical equipment that could have been used to resuscitate her when she fainted.  Ijeoma, who had a medical history of bronchitis and asthma had participated in volleyball, the scheme's sporting activity for female corps members. But while playing volleyball, she developed palpitations and collapsed. Efforts of the medical team to revive her proved abortive as there was no equipment such as the AMBU bag, adrenaline and oxygen. SaharaReporters learnt that the young lady died within two hours. A source said, ”The story was, a lady pharmacist died in the camp. I can't really tell how old she is but the said lady was rushed to the clinic. She went to play volleyball and collapsed, whereas she knew she had health conditions. A friend of mine who worked in the clinic told me about this. ”I was also in the camp but I am not a medical practitioner. My friend said there was nothing to use in reviving the lady so they started performing CPR on her but it was all to no avail because she finally died.”
