The Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in Cross River State, Comrade Ben Ukpepi, has been released by his abductors after 82 days in captivity. Ukpepi was kidnapped in front of his residence at the CROSPIL estate in the Akpabuyo Local Government Area.  It was the second time Mr. Ukpepi would be kidnapped. The organised labour in the state was planning a strike action over pending labor issues. Mr. Ukpepi was kidnapped less than 96 hours to that action, labour sources told Cross River Watch. His kidnap came when residents of Calabar and its environs were almost heaving a sigh of relief following a reduction in the rate of kidnappings in the city after the state launched a joint security task force codenamed ‘Operation Akpakwu’.
