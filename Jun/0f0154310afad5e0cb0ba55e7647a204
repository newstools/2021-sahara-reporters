Many travellers are currently trapped on the Abuja-Kaduna highway as angry residents have blocked the road over attacks, especially the killing of a 13-year-old girl by bandits. The tragic incident occurred at Anguwar Magaji in Chikun Local Government Area of the state.  According to Daily Trust, the residents said bandits stormed the village head's house and abducted his family and other persons in the community. A resident of the area said they were not safe at home and their farms. "We cannot go to our farms and yet they will follow us to our homes to abduct us for ransom. They killed a 13-year-old girl, a security man in the village as well as abducted other residents, including the family of the village head," he said. He explained that the residents only want security or to be allowed to protect themselves against the bandits. A witness said the protesters refused to listen to the plea of security personnel who approached them. The witness, who did not want to be named, said the protesters had been out since 7:30 am. "The villagers are very angry. They blocked the road and insisted that no one would pass through. When security personnel came, the men withdrew and left their women on the road." "Some of the women are half-naked. The soldiers were begging them to leave the road but the men cheered them on from the roadside." The Police Public Relations Officer in Kaduna, ASP Jalige Mohammed, said the state Commissioner of Police, Umar Muri, has directed the Area Commander to visit the protest scene and ensure orderliness. He said the police are trying to ensure that the road is open to allow road users access as they meet with the community leaders and the protesting youths to discuss the problem. "There is an incident along the highway but we are trying to control the situation," he said.
