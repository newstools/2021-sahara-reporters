The baby delivered in prison by Kemisola Ogunniyi, an 18-year-old girl detained over #EndSARS protest has been christened. The baby was named Okikiola, Samuel, Oluwapamilerin, among others.  Among those who attended the event was the wife of the Ooni of Ife, Olori Naomi Ogunwusi. The Ondo State High Court sitting at the Olokuta Medium Prison in Akure had on Tuesday granted Kemisola bail in the sum of N10 million and a surety in like sum. The nursing mother was arrested in Akure on October 24, 2020, while going to a pharmacy to buy drugs for her mother.  She was arrested by the police along with three others, saying they participated in the #EndSARS protest in the state. The police claimed they were part of the #EndSARS protesters who burnt the office of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state last year, about eight months ago. The three others are Ayodele Bukunmi, Ojo Samuel and Ani Obinna. The charges preferred against them were conspiracy to commit the following felonies, to wit: arson, riotous assembly, stealing and malicious damage. Kemisola was said to have gone into labour on June 15 and given birth to a baby boy the following day. Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, had in a Facebook post last week called on Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the state to look into the issue, adding that the mother of the newborn was innocent and never committed any offence. The post by Sowore triggered public outrage, with many Nigerians demanding her swift and unconditional release from detention.
