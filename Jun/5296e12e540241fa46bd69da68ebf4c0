The remains of a female officer of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Josephine Cynthia Onche, who went missing 18 months ago have been discovered in a shallow grave in the Obi Local Government Area of Benue state. Cynthia, who was Idoma and of Otukpo origin, suddenly went missing in December 2019 while her wedding plans were underway.  The NSCDC officer was declared missing by her family in the Otukpo Local Government Area of the state in December 2019, a few days to her wedding. After several months of uncertainty regarding her whereabouts, Cynthia’s body was exhumed last week in Obi LGA.  Her remains were discovered after her prospective husband, who had been arrested, took security operatives to the shallow grave. “An Okada man (commercial motorcyclist) who knew what happened to the late Cynthia Onche went to her family members and gave them the report.  “This led security operatives to arrest the groom who in turn led the police to Ogun State where they arrested the native doctor alleged to have performed the ritual at Obi LGA before his relocation to the South-West state. “While the suspected killer groom and the native doctor have been allegedly held by the police in Otukpo, the family of the late security woman exhumed her remains and organised a burial on Tuesday, June 1st, 2021,” a family source told journalists.
