Ahmed Apatira He said, “In what appears as a show of shame, it is saddening to comment on the lawlessness going on in Itire/Ikate Local Council Development Area (LCDA) under the clueless leadership of Ahmed Apatira. “On Thursday, 24th June 2021, thugs loyal to Apatira with instructions from Pius Soyoye, a friend of the chairman, physically assaulted the second signatory to the council’s account. “Do you know the offence? He was carrying out his legitimate duty of ensuring that public funds are not being diverted. It will be noted that the Local Government Service Commission queried Itire Ikate LCDA recently as the worst in Lagos State in terms of revenue generation. “This action should be condemned. All actors in the shameful acts should be reprimanded, including Ahmed Apatira, for his utterances which are fuelling the crisis and act as a guide to his aides. “On Friday 25th June 2021, the LCDA staff embarked on strike, the council was locked up, and even Apatira was not allowed into the council. “It’s so sad that this is happening less than a month before the council election. This same man sponsored thugs and cultists to disrupt the just concluded primary election. They were shooting guns on election day in Itire Ikate.”
