Asari Dokubo, leader of the Niger Delta Peoples Salvation Force (NDPSF), has accused Nnamdi Kanu, leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), of using the struggle for the actualisation of Biafra Republic to make money. Dokubo, in a video he released on social media, also described Kanu as a criminal.  He said, “They are now telling us India, Russia, etc. This is how they audit accounts. This is what Biafra will look like under the criminal Nnamdi Kanu. “They claim that they brought money to Cotonou to give to me — N20 million. We are waiting for them to bring the evidence. They came to Cotonou to meet with me and I hosted them. They did not bring a dime. “How is that an audited account? Why do Igbo people allow you, a conman, to be conning them? Igbos, you have to rise. He wants to destroy Onyeama. He wants to destroy Ekweremadu. He wants to destroy everybody and the Igbo people are keeping quiet. “Biafra is your business now, you have no other avenue for gainful income. It is a pity how Igbo people have fallen for this evil, but your time is up. “I am out for you. And I will get you. I just asked that our people be allowed to vote and you sent your dogs. I’ve broken their teeth. “Nnamdi Kanu, I’m not in your category but for this, I will surely bring you down. I will destroy this evil empire that is working as a hindrance to the restoration of Biafra.”
