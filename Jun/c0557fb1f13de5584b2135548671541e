The Senior Pastor of Christian Life Church, based in Kampala, Uganda, Jackson Senyonga, has celebrated the passing on of Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua, popularly known as TB Joshua, saying the late pastor was the “biggest witch in Africa.” Senyonga made the remarks in a video seen by SaharaReporters, while insisting that TB Joshua’s death is a victory for Nigerians and Africans.  Addressing his members, Senyonga accused the founder of Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN) of “sacrificing” many. Celebrating TB Joshua’s death, the clergyman recounted how the deceased allegedly tried to attack him. He said, “TB Joshua sacrificed a lot of people while thinking his soul is worth more than that of others. TB Joshua’s death means victory. He was fake, destroyed lives of thousands and was the biggest witch in Africa. “He has been doing well until he came here to destroy Senoita. TB Joshua came here to bewitch me but God punished him.” Pastor Senyonga also insisted that “heaven doesn’t rejoice when a sinner dies, TB Joshua’s death however means many will also go.” TB Joshua, aged 57, died on Sarurday while plans were underway for his 58th birthday, which was a few days away. News of his demise trended on social media in the early hours of Sunday as many Nigerians mourned the late prophet. TB Joshua’s mega church runs the popular Emmanuel TV television station from Lagos, followed by many Christians worldwide. Joshua was famous across Africa, Europe and America. His YouTube channel, Emmanuel TV, had over 1,000,000 subscribers and was the world's most viewed Christian ministry on the platform before it was suspended. He was well known for his controversial prophecies such as the Ghana terror attack, US presidential election, coronavirus and his influence in African politics. He recently predicted Nigeria would remain one despite instability in different parts of the country. He recently wrote on his Facebook page about plan to celebrate his 58th birthday.
