Food prices are beginning to rise at an alarming rate in most of the southern states as 1kg of Nigerian locally planted rice sells for about N290 in Nasarawa to Jigawa states but sells for around N950 in Lagos and Anambra states. These figures were obtained by SaharaReporters from the Selected Food Prices Watch, May 2021, report released by the National Bureau of Statistics.  SaharaReporters observed that 1kg of ofada rice sells for N260 in Nasarawa but sells for N940 in Lagos, while 1Kg of the short local rice sells for N290 in Jigawa State but N700 in Imo State. The same disparity goes for beans where people in Bauchi State buy 1kg for about N200, but in Anambra, the same quantity is sold for N670. The NBS report confirmed that the price of rice increased by 17% in 2021 from what Nigerians bought in 2020. The report noted that the prices of foodstuffs were “collected across all the 774 local governments across all states and the Federal Capital Territory from over 10,000 respondents and locations and reflect actual prices households state they actually bought those items.” Some of the prices picked by SaharaReporters in the report read, “Beans; Highest Price, Anambra (N670), Lowest Price, Bauchi (N196); Ofada rice; Highest Price, Lagos (N938), Lowest Price, Nassarawa (N259); local rice, Highest Price, Imo State (N700), Lowest Price, Jigawa (N286). “Medium grained rice; Highest Price, Bayelsa (N619), Lowest Price, Adamawa (N273); Imported rice; Highest Price, Imo (N765); Lowest Price, Borno (N384).” Checks by SaharaReporters revealed that the same goes for prices of yams and potatoes nationwide. According to the survey by the NBS, a tuber of yam is highest in Ekiti with N563 and lowest in Taraba with N102, while potatoes are highest in Akwa Ibom with N312, while they are N94 in Borno per a group of tubers.
