Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has accused the acclaimed leader of the Biafra de facto Customary Government, Asari Dokubo, of defrauding him of N20 million. Kanu made this revelation while reacting to Dokubo’s recent verbal attacks on him.  The IPOB leader also told the former Niger-Delta militant leader to steer clear offl Biafra agitation and focus on being a pipeline security guard. Asari had recently vowed to bring down Kanu, whom he described as “evil and a "con man". In a recent video, the ex-militant warlord accused Kanu of standing against the actualisation of Biafra because of his greed and selfish interest. The ex-militant leader also accused Kanu of being a thief using the agitation for Biafra as a business. Dokubo had said: “I am out for you. And I will get you. I just asked that our people be allowed to vote and you sent your dogs. I’ve broken their teeth. “Nnamdi Kanu, I’m not in your category but for this, I will surely bring you down. I will destroy this evil empire that is working as a hindrance to the restoration of Biafra.” Dokubo has been against the IPOB leader following a rift between them. The disagreement between the duo is believed to hinge on ideological differences regarding the agitation for Biafra. Reacting, Kanu wrote: “Tell him I don’t even react to a mask-wearing (President Muhammadu) Buhari imposter talk less of a hungry filthy pig that conned me of 20 million naira. “When world leaders or respected commentators talk about Biafra, I respond. I can’t dignify a petty pipeline security guard with a response. He should focus on his business ventures and leave freedom fighting to freedom fighters. “For a man of his bloated stature to belatedly realise that his father is Fulani, tells you all you need to know about him.”
