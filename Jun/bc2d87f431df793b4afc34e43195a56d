The elder sister came back from work at about 06:00pm on Tuesday, saying that she had tried several times to reach her on the phone but couldn’t as the phone kept ringing. “She came back from work to meet the door of her apartment locked and couldn’t gain entry despite repeated knocks on the door. She then called some neighbours who helped to break open the door. “They all met the deceased lying dead on the floor when they entered with her two hands tied to the back and her mouth gagged. She was met naked, bruises were noticed on her private parts, her mouth was covered, among others. “Also, a note said to have been written on a piece of paper was placed on her chest containing a message, 'Unilorin doesn’t forgive'. “The people later informed the police at F’ Division Police Station, who discovered the dead body, snapped the picture, and took the corpse to the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) for autopsy.”
