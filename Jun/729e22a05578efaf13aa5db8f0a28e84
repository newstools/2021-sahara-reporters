Gunmen suspected to be bandits have abducted the Vice Chairman of Jaba Local Government Area of Kaduna state, James Bijimi. Bijimi was whisked away on the Kaduna-Kachia road on Friday with an unspecified number of travellers.  The incident comes a few days after bandits killed a driver and kidnapped 33 other people in the Kachia metropolis. The Kaduna State Police Command spokesperson, Mohammed Jalige, confirmed the incidence but couldn’t confirm the actual number of persons taken away. He said security operatives recovered three vehicles belonging to the abductees while one person was injured. Meanwhile, a local government official said that the bandits had established contact with Bijimi’s family and are demanding a ransom of N100 million before his release.
