No fewer than two people were killed in the Inalende and Abebi areas of Ibadan, the Oyo state capital, on Thursday afternoon. SaharaReporters reports that two people were also killed on Wednesday when shop owners and members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), known as Park Management System (PMS) in the state, clashed.  The cause of the clash was unknown at the time of filing this report but our correspondent gathered that the area is generally known to be the base of cult members. SaharaReporters reports that there have been killing and robbery cases in Ibadan, the Oyo state capital, in recent time. A source told SaharaReporters that "they killed two people already. We have yet to know those behind the attack. The police have yet to get here," he said.
