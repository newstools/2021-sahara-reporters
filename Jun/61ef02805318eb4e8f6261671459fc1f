Some members of the ruling All Progressives Congress are protesting against irregularities in the party's primary election in Ikorodu West Local Council Development Area (LCDA), held last Saturday. It was gathered that the protest was organised by party members because the winner of the councillorship election was allegedly denied his right. File Photo A source, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said one of the candidates, Dare Okuyelu Adeleke emerged as the winner with 68 votes while the other candidate Tejumaiye got 9 votes. Other candidates, Adebayo got 7 votes while Ifeyale and Remi got 17 and 0 respectively. He said Tejumaiye, who got a lower vote count was declared as the winner while the candidate with the highest vote count was ignored. He lamented the injustice and bias in the election.  “This is just a primary election, ordinary APC primary election and they are doing this. People had to stage a protest today. This simply solidifies what Omoyele Sowore (a former presidential candidate) had said earlier. At a time Sowore went to Arise TV and said the ballot can no longer save us in Nigeria.” Another party member stated, “It is quite unfortunate that even after the primary, they still had the effrontery to try and steal the mandate. How can someone with 9 votes emerge as the winner ahead of someone who emerged with 68 votes? This is daylight robbery, in a democratic setting." "Ikorodu leaders, wake up. This is a slap on our face. We don't want an impostor. Give us our councillor for Ward D Ajaguro Ikorodu West, Dare Okuyelu Adeleke," another member said.44
