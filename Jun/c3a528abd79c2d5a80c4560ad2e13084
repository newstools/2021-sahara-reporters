An All Progressives Congress (APC) support group on Saturday posted on Twitter despite the suspension of the microblogging platform by the Buhari Muhammadu-led Nigerian Government. “Kindly follow @APCNigeria at trenchat.com,” the group with over 1 million followers tweeted on Saturday.  Nigeria’s information and culture minister, Lai Mohammed, had on Friday announced Twitter’s suspension in a statement by his media aide, Segun Adeyemi. The suspension by the Nigerian government comes days after a post by President Muhammadu Buhari on the 1967 civil war was deleted by the microblogging platform. The Nigerian government’s spokesman cited “the persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence” as the reason for the suspension.
