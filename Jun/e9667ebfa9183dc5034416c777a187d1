Gunmen on a motorcycle reportedly invaded Iyana Court, Ile Titun area in the Ibadan South-East Local Government Area of Ibadan and killed a family of three. Our correspondent gathered that a physically challenged man identified as Sodiq, but also known as Chicken, was the target of the attack by the hoodlums.  Sodiq, who was said to have kyphosis (also known as round back or hunchback), was shot dead, alongside his wife and daughter. The incident reportedly happened around 10:30pm on Sunday. It was gathered that the gunmen made sure that Sodiq was dead before they escaped through Olomi area. The Police Public Relations Officer in Oyo State, Adewale Osifeso, when contacted said he would find out and get back to our correspondent. He had yet to do so as at the time of filing this report.
