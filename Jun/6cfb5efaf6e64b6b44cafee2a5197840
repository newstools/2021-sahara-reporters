Director-General, National Youth Service Corps, Brigadier-General Shuaibu Ibrahim, says about 1,000 corps members nationwide have been blocked from relocating to another choice of state. Addressing journalists in Abuja at the opening ceremony of the 2020 inspectorsâ€™ development programme, he said most corps members tried to manipulate the staff of the scheme to get their relocation done, against the ethics of the scheme, DailyTrust reports.  He said the relocation was free and allowed even though it must be on health, marital or insecurity grounds. Ibrahim said over 1,000 corps members tried to deceive the staff to get their relocations done, but when this was discovered to be fraudulent, they were cancelled and withdrawn.
