The All Progressives Congress, APC, has berated Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma over his comments that Ahmed Ali Gulak's murder was politically motivated. Chairman of the Adamawa State Chapter of the party, Ibrahim Bilal, gave the reaction to journlists on Wednesday, in Yola the state capital. Hope Uzodinma Bilal also called on President Muhammadu Buhari to use the full might of the federal government to secure justice for Gulak, a former political adviser to Ex-President Goodluck Jonathan and chieftain of the APC, killed in Imo State. Bilal tasked the Buhari-led government to go after the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) agitators and crush the group, using the full might of the governement. The APC chairman also expressed regret that while Igbo were freely going about their businesses peacefully in Adamawa, Northerners in the Southeast could not enjoy the same right. He said, "We need justice over the killing of Barrister Ahmed Aliyu Gulak. Also, we want the Federal Government and the Imo State Government to investigate Gulak's death and bring the perpetrators of this gruesome killing to justice. "But most importantly, we want leaders of the Southeast to call their people to order, because we believe not all of them support the activities of IPOB, which we believe is behind the killing of our innocent son in their region. "We believe Gulak's murder was premeditated and executed, by those who had repeatedly targeted Northerners in their region. "We disagree with Governor Hope Uzodinma for inputting political motives for Gulak's death, judging from the crime scene video. "Since he has imputed political motives to it (Gulak's death), he should produce the perpetrators as the chief security officer of the state," Bilal said.
