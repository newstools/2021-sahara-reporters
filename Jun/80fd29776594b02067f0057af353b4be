Nigerians on social media have called for the usage of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) following the suspension of the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, by the Nigerian Government. VPN, according to kapersky.com, is a connection that allows users to establish a protected network connection when using public networks. It encrypts internet traffic and disguises the user's online identity. This makes it more difficult for third parties to track users' activities online and steal data. Lai Mohammed On Friday, Nigeria's Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement signed by his Special Assistant Segun Adeyemi citing the “persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence”.
