The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has been asked not to let off the hook a former acting Director, Federal Institute of Industrial Research (FIIRO), Oshodi, Lagos State, Mr. Chima Igwe, who was accused of serial manipulation of his educational status to exploit the system for personal gains. The former FIIRO acting Director was caught in a web of dirty scams after submitting a Doctor of Philosophy certificate that was later discovered to be fake.  The ICPC investigation indicted him but many Nigerians were shocked to note that Igwe remained a key staff member of the institute. Under the false claim, he had worked for 18 years at the country’s foremost research institute rising through the ladder with the same forged document.
