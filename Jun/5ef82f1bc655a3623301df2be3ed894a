Ex-militant leader of the Niger Delta Vigilante Force, King Ateke Tom, has thrown his weight behind the 7-day ultimatum given to the Federal Government by another ex-militant leader in the region, Government Ekpemukpolo, also known as Tompolo to constitute a substantive board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Tom, who is also the Amayanabo of Okochiri Kingdom in Rivers state, through a statement signed by his Chief of Staff, Chief Tamunokonba Akaluogbo, stated the decision to back the 7-day ultimatum.  Niger Delta Affairs Minister, Senator Godswill Akpabio has also been accused of mismanaging the affairs of the NDDC and the region at large. Tom called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately constitute a substantive board despite the unending forensic audit ongoing. He said: â€œIt is clear that Akpabio is deceitful and he means no good to the Niger Delta region particularly the Ijaws given his attitude towards reconstituting the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC. Time and time, the minister has failed in his promises and he is using the forensic audit as a decoy for his selfish aims. "I urge him to do the needful before the region tilts towards upheaval of breakdown of law and order again because his ineptitude and lack of genuine concern for the demands of people are capable of degenerating into violence which I don't pray for."
