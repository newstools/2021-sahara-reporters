A deadly group of vigilantes in the South-East, Bakassi Boys, after years of redundancy, has returned to some areas of Awka, Anambra State capital, Daily Trust reports. Their members were viewed in two moving vans, singing and warning criminals, but who brought them could not be ascertained.  When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Ikenga Tochukwu, said he was not aware of the development. He said, “I received this as information from you. I don’t have any such details before me. Meanwhile, I will make enquires, please." But the police spokesman quickly added, “We are ready to work with any stakeholder in security," when responding to the question as to whether the police would partner with such a group. Meanwhile, a source said, “The boys came primarily for alleged cult groups which have taken over Awka town in recent time without any response from the police. I think they were invited by traders.” A senior police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some security men had stormed the state, but failed to confirm if they were sent by the government. The source said, “That is the only thing I can tell you, for now. Let’s see how things work out in the days and weeks to come.” The Bakassi Boys are usually armed with machetes and guns, with all manner of charms worn around their body. They have been accused of extrajudicial killings. Their targets are petty thieves, armed robbers, ritual killers, murderers, corrupt persons, and generally, anyone considered evil.
