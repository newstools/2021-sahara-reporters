The camp of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the militant arm of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) at Akabo, Ikediru Local Government Area of Imo State, has been dislodged by the Nigeria police. The operation was led by the Inspector General of Police Intelligence Response Team, DCP Abba Kyari, and other security operatives on Tuesday.  During the operation, a policewoman allegedly held captive by the dislodged ESN men, was reportedly freed. ESN has been blamed by the government and security agencies for causing unrest in the South-East and attacking public facilities there.  But the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, has denied the allegations, saying ESN was formed to curb attacks by herdsmen in the region.
