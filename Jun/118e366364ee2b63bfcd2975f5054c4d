The protesters could be heard chanting: "Se democracy be this, se democracy be this, people dey die like flies, se democracy be this (Is this a democracy? People are dying like flies, is this a democracy)?Also on June 12, Democracy Day, many Nigerians also trooped to the streets in many states across the country to say they were tired of the government of Buhari. Some of the complaints include worsening insecurity, poor economy, and massive unemployment.For instance, in Ibadan, Oyo State and Akure, Ondo State, socio-economic activities were grounded to a halt following the June 12 protest embarked upon by the youths.
