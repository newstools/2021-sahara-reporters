Men of the Lagos State Police Command have arrested a comedian, Ogunleye Babatunde, popularly known as Oluwadolarz, for endorsing and advertising a Ponzi Scheme company, RackSterli, which has allegedly defrauded Nigerians. Oluwadolarz was invited for interrogation by the Area J Police Command in the Ajah area of Lagos State on Thursday. The comedian has publicly influenced and endorsed RackSterli, owned by one Chidi known as Blackgold.  In a video made at the police station, the comedian was verbally assaulted by the policemen when he was explaining that he would have to see his lawyer on the matter.  “I will consult my lawyer and I’ll cross-check the record. Let me talk now,” Oluwadolarz said.  “Are you shouting on (sic) me? Are you crazy? You said I’m shouting on you. Are you mad?” One of the policemen in the station said.  It was gathered that clients who invested in the scheme without getting returns since last year made complaints to the police. On Thursday, before his arrest, Oluwadolarz made a video running and lamenting on a Lagos highway that the policemen tried to stop and arrest him. In the video, he accused the policemen of trying to harass him as he ran beside a busy road, panting.
