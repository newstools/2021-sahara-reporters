Nigerians who spoke with SaharaReporters said they could not access the microblogging site on their phone and computers. The Nigerian government suspended Twitter's operations indefinitely after accusing the micro-blogging site of "undermining Nigeria's existence". In a statement on Friday, Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information, said the government was forced to act because of "the persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria's corporate existence".

10 Hours Ago "I cannot access Twitter on my phone," a Nigerian told SaharaReporters Saturday. Many Nigerians on Twitter are lambasting the government for the decision. A check by SaharaReporters in the early hours of Saturday showed that the platform is no more active within Nigeria except for those using Virtual Private Network (VPN). On Twitter, Nigerians who reacted to the news, are adopting Virtual Private Networks as an alternative. "Set your VPNs to Nigeria and still be getting local content. For me, it’s as if nothing happened. Try it and thank me later," a Nigerian identified as  @Natasha68324739 wrote on Twitter. The suspension comes days after a Twitter post by President Muhammadu Buhari on the 1967 civil war was deleted by the microblogging platform. The sanction of the social media service has continued to spark widespread outrage, with many Nigerians, including celebrities, condemning the move. Also reacting, the microblogging site described the directive as "deeply concerning." See Also
