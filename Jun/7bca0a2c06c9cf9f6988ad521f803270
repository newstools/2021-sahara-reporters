Socio-economic activities were grounded to a halt on Saturday in Akure, the Ondo State capital, following the June 12 protest embarked upon by the youths. The youths in their numbers took to the streets to join their counterparts across the country to demand good governance and end the challenges confronting the country.  As early as 7:30 am, the youths converged on the Post Office Junction axis in the state capital chanting “Buhari must go”. According to Daily Post, shops were not open as residents believed that the protest might be like the #EndSARS protest. Also, most of the streets were deserted as vehicles did not ply the major roads of the state capital. Armed with placards of various inscriptions, the youths emphasized that the country's security situation is now at an alarming rate as nobody is safe anymore. Some of the placards read “Buhari must go” and “No to grandpa’s regime”. Moving from junction to junction before terminating the protest at NEPA roundabout, the protesters lashed at the All Progressives Congress-led government for dashing the hopes of Nigerians.

We are saying we don’t want killings, kidnappings, and banditry anymore. We want to be safe.” Shuaib added that the protest was about Nigerians’ frustration with the Buhari administration, stressing that the government had failed to secure the people. “Buhari is not ready to listen. All we want is that Buhari must go now,” he added. Also, one of the protest leaders, Barrister Tope Temiokun, said that the country had never had it so bad since independence. He urged Nigerians to get set ahead of the 2023 general elections to do the needful. Meanwhile, security operatives were on the ground during the protest to forestall any breakdown of law and order.
