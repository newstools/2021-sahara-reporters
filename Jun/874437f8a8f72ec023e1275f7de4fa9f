Ismaeel Ahmed, one of the aides to President Muhammadu Buhari, has said he is not happy that he cannot use Twitter following the suspension of the microblogging site by the Nigerian government l. Ahmed, Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on National Social Investment Programme, disclosed this to journalists at the national secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja.  However, the presidential aide defended the suspension, saying Twitter should be more responsible if it wants to operate in Nigeria. He said, “If you ask me whether I am happy that there is no Twitter today that I cannot tweet, I will say, of course not. “I am not happy that I am not tweeting and I hope there will be an amicable resolution and I hope Twitter will be responsible going forward.” The Nigerian government last Friday announced it had suspended Twitter operations indefinitely. It said the suspension was necessary because the platform posed a threat to Nigeria's corporate existence.
