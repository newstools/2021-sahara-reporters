Garba in 2020 instituted a $1 billion lawsuit against Twitter and its founder, Jack Dorsey, at the Federal High Court Abuja, over their alleged role in the #EndSARS protests which led to violence in some parts of the country, resulting in loss of lives and destruction of properties. Jack had been accused of actively supporting the funding of the #EndSARS protests across the nation, as disclosed by Adamu Garba through a series of tweet posts on his official Twitter handle on Tuesday, October 20, 2020. Nigerians had called for the suspension of Buhari’s Twitter account for saying ‘individuals or groups who want to destroy his government will receive the shock of their lives.” Speaking on the destruction of national assets, the President had said they would be treated in a language they understand. Following the development, on Wednesday, Twitter deleted the comment, saying it violated its rules.
