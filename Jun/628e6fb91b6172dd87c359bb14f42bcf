Some gunmen have razed the country home of Imo Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Chief Declan Emelumba in the Oru East Local Government Area of the state. The attack reportedly happened in the early hours on Sunday.  Two houses in the compound were allegedly burnt down by the gunmen without any hindrance. Earlier in the day, officers of the Imo police command killed five gunmen in a foiled attack on the command. Four AK-47 rifles were recovered from the gunmen. Imo state has been experiencing a series of attacks lately, especially on security formations. On April 5, armed men invaded the headquarters of the Imo State Police Command and the Nigerian Correctional Service in Owerri, burnt the facilities and freed over 1,800 inmates. Unfortunately, one person suspected to be a fleeing prison inmate was hit by a stray bullet. A few days after, the country home of the state governor, Hope Uzodinma in Omuma, Oru East Local Government Area of the state was invaded by gunmen. During the attack, they burnt part of the building, razed some vehicles in the compound, and killed at least a security official.
