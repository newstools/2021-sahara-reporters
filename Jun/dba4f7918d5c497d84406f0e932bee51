President Muhammadu Buhari has said his government will treat bandits in the language they understand and that Nigerians will start seeing improvements in the poor security situation soon.  The president said this during an interview with Arise TV on Thursday.  The last time the President threatened to treat people "in the language they understand", he was referring to the insecurity in the South-East, but this attracted public criticism as many Nigerians found it distasteful.  The comment was also deleted by Twitter on the microblogging site, an action that later earned the site a ban in Nigeria.  “Problem in the North-West; you have people over there stealing each other’s cattle and burning each other’s villages. Like I said, we are going to treat them in the language they understand. We have given the police and the military the power to be ruthless. You watch it in a few weeks’ time there will be difference," Buhari said.  ”Because we told them if we keep people away from their farm, we are going to starve. And the government can’t control the public. If you allow hunger, the government is going to be in trouble and we don’t want to be in trouble. We are already in enough trouble. So we warn them sooner than later you’ll see the difference.” See Also
