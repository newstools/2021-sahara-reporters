At least 12 persons sustained varying degrees of injury and one died during a clash between traditional religion practitioners, including masquerade worshippers and some Muslims in Osogbo, Osun State capital, on Sunday. SaharaReporters learnt that the crisis began when the masqueraders allegedly opened gunfire near a Muslim worship centre, Kamorudeen Central Mosque, around Oluode Aranyin in Osogbo around 2.30 pm.  The Muslims were reportedly performing a special prayer for Nigeria at the mosque when the incident happened. Some children were said to have been hit by the bullets, who are now undergoing treatment at different hospitals. A Camry car and mosque windows were destroyed in the clash. One of the victims who spoke from the hospital, Isiaka Ajagbe, 37, said, “They were first throwing stones and then started firing guns at us. They destroyed the mosque. We are on our own.” The Imam of the mosque, Kazeem Yunus confirmed that the leader of the organisation in Iwo, Osun State, Moshood Salawudeen was shot in the head and gave up the ghost before getting to the hospital. “Some of our members, about 12 who sustained bullet injuries have been taken to Osun State General Hospital, Asubiaro; Osogbo central hospital and UNIOSUN central hospital while the corpse has been deposited at UNIOSUN teaching hospital mortuary,” he added.
