Tears flowed freely on Sunday as some members of the Synagogue Church of All Nations gathered to mourn the death of their General Overseer, Temitope Joshua. The pastor died on Saturday 5th June, 2021 after an evening service. He was aged 57.  The cause of his death was not immediately disclosed, but sources told SaharaReporters he fell ill two days ago. His body is believed to have been deposited at General Hospital in Isolo, Lagos. When SaharaReporters visited the church located in the Ikotun-Egbe area of Lagos, sympathisers and followers of the prophet were seen crying. They also paid tribute to the late cleric. “He told us to pray that there is no time. Who is going to help us? Who is going to help the widows? TB Joshua don go (has gone), who is going to help the widows? God, kill me instead of you to kill TB Joshua, make I die make TB Joshua come back to life (let me die instead of TB Joshua),” an aged woman was seen crying, screaming Joshua’s name and sharing testimonies of his good deeds. Another woman said, “Nobody believed we could lose an angel like this in the next 20 years. In the midst of all prophets, we didn’t expect this, it’s pained us. In this whole community, he is the source of our food. Our dream, our joy is gone. It’s so painful.” A man said, “He was a nice man, we will go there, he will feed us and still pray for us. This is very hard to believe. It is now that Nigerians will know that we have a true man of God. Nigerians did not believe in him but he was always praying for the country. God has taken his own, God has taken him.”
