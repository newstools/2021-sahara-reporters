Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju Omiyinka, popularly known as Baba Ijesha, on Thursday pleaded not guilty to charges of child molestation before an Ikeja Special Offences Court in Lagos.The actor pleaded not guilty to six counts bordering on indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault by penetration.  The offences contravene Sections 135, 259, 262, 263 and 262 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Following the plea, the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), Mrs Olayinka Adeyemi, requested that the defendant should be remanded by the court. In a bail application supported by a 29-paragraph affidavit, Lead defence counsel, Mr Dada Awosika (SAN), pleaded that his client be granted bail with liberal terms. The bail application was brought pursuant to Section 105(2) and (3) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Lagos State, 2015, and Sections 35 and 36 of the 1999 Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended). “I will wish to note that the issue of bail, especially on an offence of this nature, is a constitutional right. “This is a right the defendant has been deprived of for the past 48 days when he was unlawfully held by the police.“We are also not unconscious of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) strike which made it difficult to bring him to court,” he said. The counsel prayed the court to grant the defendant bail, saying that it was guaranteed under the 1999 Constitution. “Imagine if this man is kept in detention for many years and is found innocent, will there be any restitution? No. “Justice and fairness should be done,” he said. In response, Adeyemi urged the court to deny the defendant bail, saying he can influence witnesses.
