A league of Northern groups known as the Arewa Mandate Initiative has said the Northern part of the country is currently considering certain Southern politicians that will get their support in the upcoming 2023 general elections. Among those being considered to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari are Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi and former Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha.  The group disclosed that a majority of Northerners were in support of the rotation of power between the North and Southern regions of the country. This was disclosed in a statement signed by its coordinator, Muhammad Mubarak in Abuja on Thursday. After consultations with numerous political groups especially across All Progressives Congress platforms in the North, the group stated that there was an intense support for the next president of the country to emerge from the South. “While the North looks forward to the South to put forward the best and most acceptable material for the office of the President, the Arewa Mandate Initiative, had conducted a survey of the likely personally that could be said to possess the credentials needed to occupy the exalted office of the President of the country. “Among those that the North might be looking out for, include: The current Minister of State, Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylvia, from Bayelsa State, Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, from Rivers, and Senator Victor Ndoma Egba SAN, a former Senate Leader from Cross River state, all from the South-South,” it said.
