The Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, says he has been receiving death threats since he became the head of the anti-graft agency. He said this to confirm the statement made by Garba Shehu, a Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari, that corruption has been fighting back in Nigeria.  Bawa, who disclosed this on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, on Tuesday, said while he was away in the United States, a high-profile Nigerian told him some Nigerians wanted him dead. “Last week, I was in New York, as all Nigerians are aware of. A very senior citizen received a phone call from somebody that is not even under investigation. What the caller said to him on the phone is that; he is going to kill the EFCC Chairman. “He said, ‘I am going to kill him. I am going to kill him’. This is to tell you how bad it is. It is actually real. Corruption can fight back," Bawa said. In February 2021, the 40-year-old Bawa was announced as the new EFCC chairman to replace Ibrahim Magu, the former acting chairman of the anti-graft agency.
