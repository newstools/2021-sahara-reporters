It was gathered that the incident took place along Iwuanyanwu road in Atta community, where the bandits laid siege in a sky blue jeep. A villager, who spoke to SaharaReporters, said the burial guests missed their way to Chetakwa morgue at Amawo Atta and were stuck at Evan Enwerem’s junction. “There are two Chetakwa mortuaries here in Atta, but it seems they were confused about the actual one where the corpse was. “They briefly stopped at the junction and almost immediately, three armed men jumped out of a sky blue jeep and ordered all to lie down. “They went to the driver of a 4matic jeep and asked for the owner of the car. “They forcefully brought out the lady who admitted it was her husband’s car and zoomed off with her, shooting sporadically in the air.” Meanwhile, the Atta community has been gripped with fear as there was a heavy presence of policemen patrolling the area and threatening arrest.
