No fewer than 12 persons were killed on Sunday night by suspected Fulani herdsmen in Kushe community and Kuru District of Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State. It was gathered that the killing took place around 9:30 pm when suspected Fulani herdsmen stormed the community and shot sporadically at residents.  About three women and nine men were killed while five persons survived the attack with gunshots injuries. It was learned that most of the victims were taken unaware as many were returning home while some were in their sleep. The member representing Jos South/Jos East Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Dachung Musa Bagos wept when he sighted the corpses littered the community. “We are tired over the continued killings in my constituency without any help, government must rise to its responsibility of protecting lives and property. “I, therefore, urge my people to defend themselves because the government has failed in their responsibility of defending the people.”
