A former Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, has been asked to answer for about N250 million unapproved contracts as well as unremitted revenue at the Nigeria Police Academy, Wudil, Kano State, in 2018 when he was in charge of the Nigeria Police Force.  Idris served as the Inspector General between June 2016 and January 2019, and he is being asked to account for financial misappropriations at the police academy. This query was contained in the annual report of the Auditor-General of the Federation for 2018, a copy of which was obtained by SaharaReporters.  The report alleged non-remittance of revenue, awards of unauthorised contracts as well as other financial infractions. The audit report says, “Issue one; Non-remittance of Internally Generated Revenue; N46,457,934.92; Audit observed in the financial year 2017 that, out ofN56,740,802.87 being Internally Generated Revenue to the Federal Government, the sum of N46,457,934.92 was not remitted. The funds were received in cash and the Academy was not on the Treasury Single Account (TSA) system at the time. This indicates weaknesses in internal controls operated by the management of Police Academy, Wudil. “The Inspector-General of Police is required to remit the sum of N46,457,934.92 being the unremitted Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) to the Treasury Single Account (TSA) maintained in the Central Bank of Nigeria. Sanctions in line with FR3112 (i) and (ii) should apply. “Also, unauthorised variation of contracts – N204,342,446.77; Audit observed that the contract sum of N84,145,095.24 for the construction of a 90m by 90m new parade ground was awarded and paid for in 2012 by the defunct Ministry of Police Affairs. Approval was given by the commandant without recourse to the Ministry. In 2013, the then Commandant modified the expansion of the construction to 120m by 120m square at an additional cost of N70,200,885.56 without any further tendering process, bringing the total cost to N154,345,980.80. “Furthermore, the project was abandoned, the stage of work and the details of payment made before abandonment was not disclosed. A second variation cost for the review of the layer thickness was put at N49,950,125.65 thus bringing the final total contract sum to N204,942,446.22. “The Inspector-General of Police is required to account for and justify the payment of the sum of N35,000,000 and to substantiate the genuineness of contract, failing which sanctions in line with FR3106 should apply. “The Inspector-General of Police is required to provide evidence (Circular and signed agreement) to support the genuineness of the payment, or otherwise recover the sum of N15, 650,067.85.”
