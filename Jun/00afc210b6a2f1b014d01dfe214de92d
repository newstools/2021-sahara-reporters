A former Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Assembly Matters, Abdurrahman Sumaila, has claimed that no right-thinking Nigerian will support the candidature of any South-East politician vying for the presidency in 2023. Sumaila made this known in a statement he issued to newsmen in Kano on Thursday.  According to him, the extant situation in the southeast is an indication that the region cannot be entrusted with the country's leadership. He said, “With these atrocities committed by the South-East people on record, how can Nigerians entrust them to govern us? I am sure not a single right-thinking Nigerian will endanger his life to support the candidature of any South-East politician contesting for presidency come 2023 general elections.” Sumaila also stated that it has now become clear that the motive behind the attacks is to cause anarchy in the country. He lamented that “the perpetrators of the attacks must understand that if there is chaos in the country, then nobody including the perpetrators can escape”. He urged elders in the South-East to publicly denounce the ongoing attacks by suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) or be considered complicit in the dastardly act. The ex-presidential aide said until the Southern elite makes their position definite, Nigerians would consider them part and parcel of the attacks being carried out in the region by armed militia. “The elite in the South-East should borrow a leaf from their northern counterparts such as Arewa Consultative Forum and Northern Elders Forum, who have been persistently condemning the activities of Boko Haram fighters and bandits in the North,” he said.
