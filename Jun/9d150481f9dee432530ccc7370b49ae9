The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has elected Comrade Abdulmajeed Oyeniyi as its National President.  This comes a few months after a faction in the association announced Sunday Asefon as its President amid chaos and violence that characterised its convention at the old parade ground, Abuja.  Asefon, a civil servant with the Ekiti State Government, got 155 votes to defeat his closest rival, Olushola Oladoja, who had 100 votes.  Outgoing President of the Association, Comrade Danielson Bamidele Akpan in a statement obtained by SaharaReporters congratulated Oyeniyi. See Also
