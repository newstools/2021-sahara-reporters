President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the composition of a team to engage with the microblogging platform, Twitter on behalf of the Nigerian government.

Many people, largely were also starved to death, so Buhari's comment was described as distasteful by many Nigerians, who asked Twitter to delete the tweet. However, POLITICS NIGERIA gathered that the approval was announced in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who will chair the team. The Federal Government’s team also comprises the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola and Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo as well as other relevant government agencies.
