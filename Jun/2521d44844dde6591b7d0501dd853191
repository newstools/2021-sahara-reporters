President Muhammadu Buhari has described Boko Haram terrorists as home-bred Nigerian victims of unemployment and poverty. The President admitted that the country is currently facing severe poverty and unemployment which makes the insurgency in the North-East problematic. President Buhari The President disclosed that he asked one of the governors in the North-East about the identities of the insurgents and was told that they are Nigerians, and not foreigners from neighbouring countries. Buhari said this during Arise News TV programme monitored by SaharaReporters on Thursday. “The problem of the North-East was difficult. The present governor is working very hard. He’s taking a lot of risks. I asked him, this Boko Haram, is it our people? Is it Nigerians or other people from other countries? He said they are Nigerians. “Like I said, you can’t kill innocent people and say 'God is great'. We have a problem of unemployment. We have a lot of youths looking basically for what to eat, not to talk of accommodation and others. “The level of poverty is almost unimaginable. So this is our problem. Those really keeping in touch with what we are doing, they know the difference between the time we came in and now. “The people of North-East and South-South are the judges of this administration and the conditions they were in before,” the Nigerian President said.
