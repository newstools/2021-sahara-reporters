The apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has stated that the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, will mark the end of violent agitations in the South-East. This was contained in a statement issued on Tuesday by Okechukwu Isiguzoro, the group's General Secretary. Nnamdi Kanu Ohanaeze said Kanu's arrest will serve as a deterrent to others, warning that self-determination should not be used to garner wealth. The group also noted that Kanu's refusal to adhere to the advice of leaders and elders in the South-East is responsible for his misfortune. The statement read, “Ohanaeze Ndigbo calls for calm and cautions Igbos to desist from any form of protests and processions that will bring more catastrophe for Southeastern Nigeria. “The re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu the leader of IPOB is the beginning of the end of violent agitations in southeastern Nigeria and a lesson to others that deviation from the nonviolent agitations contradicts what Igbos are known for, and self-determination should not be used for purposes of fortune and fame-seeking. “Nnamdi Kanu's refusal to adhere to the advice of Igbo leaders, elders, and political leaders is the outcome of what had befallen him. He made a lot of enemies, especially those that would have saved him and Federal Government will never loosen its grip on him again. We don't think that any Igbo leader will stick out his/her neck for him, his re-arrest will eventually bring peace and stability to the region and avert another civil war that was raging on." The group urged the Nigerian government to handle the situation carefully to prevent violent revolts because of Kanu's many followers. It added that "his trial should be strictly based on the laws of the land. They shouldn't kill him because it will destabilise the entire country.”
