Human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju has hinted that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) may present either Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal or Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed as its Presidential candidate in 2023. Adeyanju, Wednesday, revealed this via a series of tweets, adding that the PDP’s stakeholders are fed up of fielding former President Atiku Abubakar.  The activist claimed that PDP chieftains and stalwarts are embittered that Atiku allegedly dumped the party and left for Dubai, UAE after the party lost a presidential election. He also revealed the person the PDP is considering to be a running mate will emrge from the South. Adeyanju said: “PDP stakeholders want to present Tambuwal or Bala Mohammed, both serving Governors as presidential candidate and someone from South as VP in 2023. “They say everybody is tired of the Dubai man with dollars. Why won’t you guys present him now? I want to see you guys in opposition for 16yrs. “Many of them are so pained that the man abandoned their party after the election and relocated to Dubai for two years but is now back to start campaigning for another ticket. “The only way PDP can get real sense is if they spend 16yrs in opposition. APC should present an acceptable candidate in 2023.”
