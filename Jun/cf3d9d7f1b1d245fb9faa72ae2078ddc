It, however, reiterated its stance that a referendum was important despite Kanu’s arrest. It also said agitations for the Biafra Republic will not be affected by the arrest. The spokesman for the group, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman commended the effort of the federal government and the agencies involved in making the arrest. It thanked the International Police and authorities of the United Kingdom for honouring their obligations to Nigeria. The group also said Kanu, who has a pending trial for treasonable felony and jumping bail, must now face additional charges of alleged incitement to violence and killing of people of other ethnicities particularly northerners and security personnel as a result of his open incitement. The statement said, “More importantly, we don’t see Kanu’s arrest affecting the issue of Biafra. While he faces trial hopefully, the CNG is insisting that this is the right time to tackle the Biafran issue once for all.” The coalition explained that nobody should make the mistake of assuming that the arrest is anywhere near the end of the Biafran affair, insisting, “We stand our ground that a referendum must be held to determine this and all other agitations for self-determination from any part of the country.”
