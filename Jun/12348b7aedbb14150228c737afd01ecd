The Students’ Union of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko has explained why the union has not distributed relief materials meant for students of the school affected by fire outbreak. SaharaReporters had reported how the union President, Oluwasegun Obagunwa (SUPREME) and Senate President, Abiola Amodu (EJA NLA) were accused of diverting the items worth millions of naira.  The Nigerian government through the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) had in January 2021 approved the distribution of relief materials to persons affected by fire outbreak in Iwaro Oka and Akungba Akoko, both in the Akoko South West Local Government Area. SaharaReporters gathered that 50 bags of 12.5kg rice, 50 bags of 12.5kg garri, 50 mattresses, 50 blankets and 300 yards of Ankara textile were handed over to Obagunwa and Amodu on February 11 for distribution to affected students.

1 Day Ago But four months after, it was learnt the students’ leaders refused to share the items. Speaking to SaharaReporters, Obagunwa said the reason for not sharing the items was because the affected students had yet to resume. He said, “The reason why the palliatives have not been shared is that the union want the affected students to resume fully. Currently, only one of them is around while others are still recuperating at home. Which means many of those students affected by the fire incident have yet to resume.”
