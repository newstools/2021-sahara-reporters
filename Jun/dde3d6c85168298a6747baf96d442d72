The United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria has condemned the recent suspension of the microblogging platform, Twitter. This was contained in a statement issued by the Public Affairs Section of the Embassy.  The mission noted that the ban on Twitter undermines the ability of Nigerians to exercise a fundamental human right as allowed by the constitution. It also stated that the ban presents a poor image of the country to citizens, investors and businesses. It read, “Nigeria's constitution provides for freedom of expression. The Government's recent #Twitterban undermines Nigerians’ ability to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses. “Banning social media and curbing every citizen’s ability to seek, receive, and impart information undermines fundamental freedoms. As President Biden has stated, our need for individual expression, open public conversation, and accountability has never been greater. The path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less communication, alongside concerted efforts toward unity, peace, and prosperity. #KeepitOn." Last Friday, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed announced an indefinite suspension of Twitter after the platform deleted a tweet by the President which violated its rules.
