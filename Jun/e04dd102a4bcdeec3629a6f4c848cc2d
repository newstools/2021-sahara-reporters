1 Minute Ago Aliyu Kofa, Publicity Secretary of the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnic (ASUP), said the wife of another lecturer, Ahmed Abdu, and two of his children were also kidnapped but released on Friday morning. He did not provide details as to how they were released, adding that two students sustained gunshot wounds. “One of them, Ahmed, from the department of statistics, died in the hospital from the injuries,” Kofa said in the statement. “While the other is still receiving medical attention at the clinic.” The attack is the latest in a series of the abduction of students and pupils by bandits operating in the state. On March 11, 2021, gunmen abducted students of Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, Afaka, Igabi LGA, in Kaduna. On April 20, 2021, students of Greenfield University were kidnapped from the school campus in Chikun LGA, still in the state.
