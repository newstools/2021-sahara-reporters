Nigerians on social media have lambasted the Federal Government for announcing the suspension of the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria. On Friday, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, had announced the suspension in a statement signed by his Special Assistant Segun Adeyemi, citing the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence.  The Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria. The development comes after Twitter deleted President Muhammadu Buhari’s tweet where he threatened to treat Nigerians “misbehaving” in “the language they understand”. Buhari had in a tweet on Tuesday stated that his government would get “harder” on those hell-bent on destroying the country. The microblogging platform also yanked off a video which showed President Muhammadu Buhari threatening to deal with youths of the South-East. The video, according to Twitter, might have violated the rules or ”may be in response to a valid and properly scoped request from an authorized entity in a given country". Meanwhile, the Federal Government's announcement of an indefinite suspension has attracted the outrage of Nigerians who viewed the suspension as contrary to freedom of expression. Many questioned why the Nigerian government would take away such a vital platform from Nigerian youths who make business transactions thereon. Others have condemned the hypocrisy of the Nigerian government as the announcement was made via the same platform that was supposedly suspended.
