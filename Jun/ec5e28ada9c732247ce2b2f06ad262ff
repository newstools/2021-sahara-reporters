The commission is being asked to account for N17 million which it earmarked as the cost of transformers and streetlights, according to a 2018 government’s audit report.

Two, the contract for the establishment of solar powered streetlights at Zaria Prison, Kaduna State, for the sum of N4,614,054.20. The audit report reads, “Issue 1 – Inflation of contracts; Financial Regulations 3102 state that “(a) Any public officer who is alleged to be involved in the inflation of contract shall be allowed 5 days within which to respond to the audit query addressed to him. “Where the query involves an Accounting Officer, he shall be reported to Mr. President. In the case of any other officer, he shall be surcharged appropriately and removed from the duty schedule, dismissed, and prosecuted. (b) Where the inflation of the contract involves the Tenders Board, all the members that approved the inflated contract shall be severally and collectively sanctioned.” “Audit observed that, contracts on sampled capital projects such as, supply and installation of transformers, Solar Street Lights, Solar Boreholes, and purchase of office stamps were inflated to the tune of N17,603,083.74. The summary is as follows: “One; inflation on Solar Streetlight, N14,340,092.85; two; Inflation on Solar Borehole, N2,334,828.14; three, inflation on transformer, N638,962.75 and Purchase of Office Stamp, N289,200.” “Recommendations – The Director-General is required to recover the inflated contract amount of N17,603,083.74 and remit same to the CRF.
