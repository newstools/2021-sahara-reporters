Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu has warned that there must be retaliation for any Southeasterner killed by Nigerian security agencies. Kanu said this while sharing some images of Southeasterners allegedly shot and killed by security operatives in the region. Nnamdi Kanu The IPOB leader said his pro-Biafra group was prepared to realise Biafra by force since the Nigerian government has declined to conduct a referendum which, according to him, is the easiest way to go. “What we ask is very simple. Give us referendum for the people to determine their fate in this Fulani-controlled zoo called Nigeria,” Kanu said in a Facebook post. “But if a referendum which is the easiest way to go about it can’t be assured, then we will take it by force. “We can never continue in a country created by a white man meant for their own interests which turns us into slaves. Never! Our fathers accepted that but this generation said 'No'. “Simply conduct a referendum and allow the will of the people to reign. “The same way we triumph is the same way we’ll continue to triumph over any option they present to us going forward.” Talking about the killing of some IPOB members in Imo and other parts of the Southeast, Kanu stated, “I hope those half-baked graduates yapping on media are taking note of it!. “What these janjaweeds must understand is that it’s no longer the time we do cry to the world. “For any Biafran you kill, there must be a pay back. We will avenge their deaths with the heads of their killers. Eye for an eye.”
