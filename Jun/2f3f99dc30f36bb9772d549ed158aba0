The Enugu State Police Command has arrested an aged woman for allegedly giving out her seven-year-old granddaughter to different men as a sex slave, and collecting the money. The woman, whose name was concealed for investigation purposes, was arrested first by Ugwuagor vigilantes in the Abakpa community in the Enugu East Local Government Area of the state.  SaharaReporters learnt that the victim narrated to the vigilantes how her grandmother sent her to various men who had carnal knowledge of her. Another male suspect, identified only as Miracle, from Calabar in Cross River State, who was one of those who had had sexual intercourse with the little girl, was also arrested. The police are still on the trail of other abusers. “This brother, (referring to Mr. Miracle) if I come to his shop, he will insert his private part in my body. He does this almost every day with the knowledge of my grandmother. “There's another brother I don't know where he lives, after putting his private part in my body yesterday, he gave my grandmother N1,500,” the girl tearfully narrated. The victim added that her mother stayed in Lagos. The Abakpa Police Station Divisional Officer said the matter was being investigated by the division and they would take further action after completing their investigation.
