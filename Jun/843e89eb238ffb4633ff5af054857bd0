In October 2020, from Ondo to Oyo to Lagos to the nationâ€™s capital and parts of many other states, thousands of youths hit the streets to protest against harassment and extra-judicial killings by operatives of the now-disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The demonstrations garnered the support of several influential figures across the world, especially after operatives of the Nigerian Army stormed the Lekki tollgate protest ground in Lagos and opened fire on unarmed protesters on the night of October 20.  SaharaReporters gathered that some of the protesters who participated in demonstration are still languishing in prisons accross the country eight months after. The charges preferred against them are conspiracy to commit the following felonies, to wit: arson, riotous assembly, stealing and malicious damage. At the Surulere Prison in Ondo West Local Government Area of Ondo state, three persons namely Ayodele Bukunmi, Ojo Samuel and Ani Obinna have been in detention for the past eight months.
