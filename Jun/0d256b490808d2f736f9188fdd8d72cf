The Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday ordered the detention of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu till July 26, 2021 for continuation of his trial. Kanu is facing charges bordering on treasonable felony instituted against him at the court in response to years of campaign for the independent Republic of Biafra through IPOB.  He was granted bail in April 2017 for health reasons but skipped bail after flouting some of the conditions given to him by the court. In a broadcast via Radio Biafra, Kanu boasted that the Nigerian court lacks the capacity to try him, describing the court as a Kangaroo court. He said the judge who asked his sureties to produce him should have asked the army why they invaded his residence. “Nigerian court is a Kangaroo court. I did not jump bail, I left because the court failed to protect me,” he said. The Nigerian government on Tuesday announced his arrest and extradition to Nigeria to continue facing trial. He was subsequently arraigned while being masked before Binta Nyako, a Judge of the Federal High Court in Abuja. SaharaReporters gathered that Nyako ordered the IPOB leader detained until July 26, 2021 for continuation of trial.
