The Nigerian security operatives have allegedly arrested a senior commander of the Ambazonia separatist fighters, General Black Mamba around the Ikom border town. According to Biafra Nations League (BNL), scores of Ambazonians were also arrested alongside the leader, which has caused tension and panic at the Nigeria-Cameroon boeders, Daily Post reports.  The security agencies are said to be carrying out the arrest after the Ambazonians attacked Nigeria security men and took their guns. In a statement signed by its Deputy National Leader and Head of Operations BBs Media, Ebuta Akor Takon, the group said it has directed its members at land borders of Cameroon, especially those of Ejagham extraction to suspend any cross-border dealings with Southern Cameroons until the situation is calm. Recall that BNL, based in the Bakassi Peninsula, had told companies operating under Nigeria in the Bakassi peninsula to vacate the area. The group alleged that Nigeria gets 60 per cent of the oil in the region and uses the money to “sponsor” the Nigerian military against the secessionist agenda. A BNL commander, alias ‘Aso Rock’ accused the Nigerian government of “killing armless pro-Biafra supporters in Imo State and Rivers State”. The native of Bakassi revealed that Nigeria does not have rights over the area since its territorial ownership was ceded to Cameroon.
