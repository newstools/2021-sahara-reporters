6 Hours Ago Sowore and other well-meaning individuals had called for the immediate release of the young lady, who was arrested in Akure and has been imprisoned since October 24, 2020, while going to a pharmacy to buy drugs for her mother. However, in a recent post on his Twitter handle on Thursday, Sowore stated that the Ondo State government has insisted on holding the baby and mother in custody. He said the lawyer of the lady had filed an application for bail on request of the government, but a date had yet to be given for hearing. The human rights activist also noted that the prison guard who accompanied Ogunniyi to the hospital is now being accused of taking photos of the nursing mother and her baby and releasing the same to the public. He wrote, “UPDATE on #FreeKemisola: Since revealing the horrible/inhuman condition to which #EndSARS Kemisola Ogunniyi and newborn baby has been subjected since yesterday many public-spirited individuals and groups have tried to get @RotimiAkeredolu to free her unconditionally but as it is typical of power-drunk wicked politicians, Ondo state government is insisting on holding Kemisola and the baby in state custody.  typical of power drunk wicked politicians, Ondo state govt is insisting on holding Kemisola and the baby in state custody. They are requesting that her lawyer file an application for bail, which is already done but theyâve refused to give a date for hearing and stalling all day.  “They are requesting that her lawyer file an application for bail, which is already done but they’ve refused to give a date for hearing and stalling all day. ”I had a chat with the Attorney Gen of the state, Charles Titiloye (formerly a Human Rights lawyer), he insists that his office will not end the case but will be willing to work on granting bail. He claims there are nominal complainants that won’t let him file a nolle. I was shocked! ”Meanwhile, they’ve now begun to persecute the prison guard who accompanied her to the hospital accusing the fellow of taking her photos, those of the baby and releasing same to the public. These people are heartless. We insist on the unconditional release of Kemisola and three others.”
