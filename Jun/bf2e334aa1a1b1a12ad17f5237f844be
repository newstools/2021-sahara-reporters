On Wednesday evening, around 5pm, a group of armed bandits attacked a Fulani settlement located on the outskirts of Anka town along Bagega-Anka Road in Zamfara state. The said bandits who stormed the area and started shooting sporadically, stole an unspecified number of cows belonging to the members of the community.  A witness also told newsmen that a motorcycle belonging to the Fulani head in the community was also set ablaze by the armed bandits. According to a statement released on Thursday by the spokesperson for the police command in the state, Shehu Mohammed, the rustled cows were later recovered by joint security operatives after engaging in a gun battle with the bandits. He said the joint security operatives successfully repelled the attackers who fled into the forest with gunshot wounds. “A combined police team in collaboration with the military mobilised to the scene where they engaged the hoodlums in a gun duel. As a result, they scampered to the forest and escaped with possible gunshot wounds. “All the rustled cows were recovered for the Fulani community members. Rigorous confidence-building patrol is being sustained to avert any attempt by the bandits to regroup for another onslaught,” Shehu Mohammed said.
