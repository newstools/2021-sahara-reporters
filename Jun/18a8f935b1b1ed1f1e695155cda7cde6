Major markets and shops in many parts of Abeokuta, Ogun State, were shut as Yoruba nation agitators and youths protested in the city.  The youths and agitators held June 12 protests in Abeokuta, Ijebu-Ode, Sango, and other parts of the state.   From a video obtained by SaharaReporters, a handful of protesters armed with #BuhariMustGo and #YorubaNation placards flooded the streets of Abeokuta.

It was also gathered that major markets in Ijebu-Ode, Ilaro, Sango, and other places were affected over the fear of a clash between pro and anti-government protesters.  As early as 7:30 am, joint security teams embarked on a show of force around the state capital and some parts of the state to curtail the activities of the protesters.  In another video obtained by SaharaReporters, Yoruba Nation Now protests were held in Washington, United States of America, with the agitators calling for a referendum.  Some of the agitators carried placards written, '1999 constitution is a fraud', '1914 amalgamation is a fraud' among others.
