The Oyo State Government has blamed Wednesday's mayhem that claimed two lives in the Iwo Road area of Ibadan, the state capital, on politics. It vowed to fish out and prosecute those behind the mayhem.  The state Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Dr. Wasiu Olatubosun stated this while featuring on a Noble FM interview programme on Thursday. The commissioner said security agencies had started an investigation into the cause of the crisis. There was a reported clash between some members of the transport union in the state, which led to the killing of two youths and the destruction of private properties.

7 Hours Ago Olatubosun said the state government was on top of the situation and that the people responsible for it would not go unpunished. “I am not going to say this is the person that caused the mayhem or that person started it, it is not in my purview. The security agents are working on unravelling the cause and who are behind the attack. “This is a government that has been going to the extent of expending so much in making security of lives and property seamless, we shall not allow this to go without getting those behind it accountable,” he said. The commissioner noted that politics should not be allowed to affect the security of the people. According to him, those playing politics with security should be seen as not ready to join hands with the present administration, led by Governor Seyi Makinde to move the state forward.
