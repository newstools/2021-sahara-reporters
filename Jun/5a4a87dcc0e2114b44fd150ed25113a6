Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Thursday, barred the governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu from investigating the Chief Judge of the state. The chief judge of the state, Justice Oluwatoyin Akeredolu had filed a suit to stop the state government from investigating her over a viral video made by a citizen of the state, Olupelumi Fagboyegun.  Akeredolu had sued the Governor, the Attorney General of the state, and the House of Assembly, asking the court to stop them from probing her. She also asked the court to stop the AGF, NJC and the IGP from acting on any report submitted to them by the Ondo State government pending the determination of the main suit. Justice Ekwo had, on February 25, 2021, restrained the governor and all the defendants from taking any further steps about the alleged probe of the state chief judge over the viral video. The judge gave the order in a ruling on an ex parte application filed by Justice Akeredolu.
