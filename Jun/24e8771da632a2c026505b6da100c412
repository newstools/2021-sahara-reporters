Kaduna-based Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi has said that bandits find themselves in the criminal activities because of the ugly situations in the country. The controversial Islamic scholar who has been at the forefront of advocating negotiations for the bandits, however, said they are fed up and would embrace peace.  Gumi, Tuesday, disclosed this in a chat with DAILY POST, adding that the bandits are ready to surrender their weapons for peace to reign provided they have good partnership with the handlers of the government. When asked if bandits were tired, Gumi said: “Yes, it’s very true because bandits are saying they were pushed into banditry by circumstances. “If they have a genuine partner, they are ready to stop it; they are tired and want peace. “As regards their ongoing activities, you realise that even when soldiers are fighting and a ceasefire is declared, it takes a long time before they stop fighting. “We are able to see about 80 per cent of the big ones and then some small splinter groups which we could not meet because due to circumstances as we cannot go into the bush again. “But generally, they are ready for peace, in fact, we have gathered their representatives, discussed with them, and they said they are ready but need a genuine partner. Politics is the cause of this issue.” Bandits have been wreaking havoc in the Northern part of the country.
