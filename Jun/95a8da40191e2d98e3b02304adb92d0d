Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has said that the alleged continued assaults on members of the group and people in the South-East cannot stop the actualisation of the sovereign nation of Biafra. Kanu, who had on several occasions, accused the Nigerian Army and police operatives of killing IPOB members as a means of quelling the agitation reiterated that no amount of killings can halt their agitation.\ Nnamdi Kanu Meanwhile, the security agencies in the South-East had also named the IPOB members and its security wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN) as the brains behind several attacks and killings of their men as well as destruction of government facilities. Kanu, who is calling for a referendum to allow the secessionists decide whether to be part of Nigeria or a separate nation, said killings would not solve the problem. According to him, the actualisation of Biafra would still take place despite the alleged killings. He made the remark on Thursday in a tweet via his official Twitter handle. “At the end of this tortuous journey, history will record that referendum, NOT bullets, determined their fate. “It matters not how many they kill; one outcome is inevitable, Biafra MUST emerge a FREE nation. The sooner the Caliphate understand (sic) this inevitability, the better for all," Kanu said on Twitter.
