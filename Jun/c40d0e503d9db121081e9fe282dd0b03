The Kaduna State Government has alerted security agencies to the need to deploy more personnel to Kaduna-Abuja Road, Kafanchan and at least seven other communities, saying it got intelligence of attacks on these locations. The Kaduna State Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs stated this in a memo to the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, titled, “Need for Enhanced Security Along Kaduna – Abuja Road, Kafanchan and Adjoining Routes from June 10 to June 13, 2021.”  The memo which was obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday was signed by the commissioner, Samuel Aruwan. It was copied to the state commissioner, National Security and Civil Defence Corps, Kaduna State Government, the police, the military and the Department of State Security Service. It partly reads, “Credible intelligence available to the Kaduna State Government has highlighted the need for enhanced security along the Kaduna-Abuja Road, in Kafanchan and along the adjoining routes over the next few days. “Reports to the ministry recommend increased vigilance in these areas between Thursday, June 10 and Sunday, June 13. In view of this, I write to bring to your attention the need for enhanced security along the Kaduna-Abuja road, Kafanchan, and its connecting routes from Kaduna, Kachia, Abuja, Jere, Kwoi, Jos, Nimbia and Gidan Waya during this period. “To this end, I therefore appeal for your kind facilitation with respect to the increased deployment of personnel from Thursday to Sunday.”
