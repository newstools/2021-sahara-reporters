1 This house must not fall    Though brick after brickIt creaks like a hapless shackWeighted down by History’s burden Once Sphere of InfluenceOf foreign conquerors who foraged Distant lands for God and Country; A fiercely treasured booty between Treacherous ocean and insatiable desertA cynical assortment of parts, random, raw,Which have never masteredThe art of bonding into a steady whole Bumbling bedlam of tribes and tongues…..Eating each other’s spleenShibboleth-shouters at  hellsgate, Incapable of hearing “My tribe is triber than yours” “My tongue is home to more divisive verbsYou surely need an expensive passportFor the country of my madness….” The devil in the differenceBorne of a misbegotten samenessA century-old sore festersOn the wound between our minds Victims of a mapWhich forgot its compassUnable to live with one anotherBecause we cannot live with ourselves Niyi Osundare 2 Drums of discordShouts of warWe heard these noises not long agoIn the war which produced no Victor But countless Vanquished.The wounds are legion; The scars still live in our songs Memoryless, mad, and utterly blind Our nation is the toad which forgot its taleThat mindless nanny goat whipped countless timesFor repeated transgressions: season after season, We drown in the same river of unknowing Always, wrong wo/men in the right placesHideous, hidebound, insufferably haughty Medieval in their methods, dark in their deedsDeaf to the throes of a nation dying in their hands And so, another season of songs of severance:Incapable of the wisdom to build the houseWe crave for the folly to tear it apartWe act first, and think later But into how many parts this time?How many more wars over the spoils of officeHow can a land so brave and blessedSpawn a genealogy of rulers so blind, so blighted Victims of a mapWhich forgot its compassUnable to live with one anotherBecause we cannot live with ourselves 3 Can a country of wise wo/men Be ruled by a Confederacy of FoolsHow foolish must those Ruled beAnd how wise the Fools?  Africa’s Sick GiantLaughing stock of the worldNigeria thrashes around the jungleLike a snake with a trampled head This odd, accidental assortment of Fierce, dangerously unequal partsRiled by riot, threatened by rift,Legatees of a Dubious Imperial Mandate Too dim, too divided, to RE-make HistoryAnd UN-make its errorsScared of that tough, regenerative VisionTo RE-build this House and make it  stand Every nation is nothing If not a-work-in-progressRE-thought, RE-shaped, RE-calibratedIn answer to  noble necessity and  moral imperative, From Lord Lugard’s lemonA jar of regenerative lemonadeFor if we let this House fallWe all may fall with it Victims of a mapWhich forgot its compassUnable to live with one anotherBecause we cannot live with ourselves June 4, 2021          Niyi  Osundare
