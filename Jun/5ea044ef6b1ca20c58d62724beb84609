Residents of the area said there have been increased patrol of the areas by police patrol vans, blowing sirens throughout the day, andcausing panic among the people. The body of the deceased policeman was evacuated by a team of policemen and officials of the Federal Road Sector Corps (FRSC) shortly after the incident. According to the Baale of Alaagba village, a sleepy town between Oyo–Ogun border, Chief Adekunle Olabamiji, the fierce-looking gunmen suspected to be Fulani had laid an ambush in the surrounding forest for the expatriates. He said it was shocking to witness such a gory scene, especially as the railway workers were always guarded by policemen and soldiers. The kidnappers were said to have taken the Chinese men immediately after disarming the security men and headed to the forest. Speaking on the incident, Mr. Azeez Adila, who is the youth leader of Adeaga village, narrated how members of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) traced the kidnappers into the forest, searching the entire bush path in an attempt to apprehend the kidnappers and rescue their victims. He said despite the efforts made by the village youths and the OPC members, the kidnappers and the expatriates could not be found. The police public relations officer (PPRO), Ogun State Command, Mr. Abimbola Oyeyemi did not answer his calls. But a source close to the Command confirmed the death of a policeman attached to the Chinese workers.
