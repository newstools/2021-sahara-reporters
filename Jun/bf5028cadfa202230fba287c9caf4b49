Militants belonging to the Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) on Tuesday razed a military formation in Kwamdi village, Damboa Local Government Area of Borno State. The attack comes two days to the planned visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to the State, which is the epicentre of insurgency war in Nigeria. Sahara Reporters Media Ahead of his election in 2015, Buhari had promised to defeat Boko Haram but six years into his government, that promise has not been fulfilled. In February 2020, residents of the state booed the President as his convoy drove in and when it was leaving Maiduguri, state capital, during a condolence visit. The residents were heard shouting in Hausa “Bama so, ka samu a kunya.” Meaning “We don’t want you, because you have disappointed us.” Thursday will be the first time the President will visit Borno since the February 2020 incident. According to Daily Trust, Boko Haram terrorists overran a military formation in the Southern part of the state on Tuesday evening and carted away weapons belonging to the military during a gun duel. The fighters were said to have stormed the area in 10 utility vehicles, and burnt down one Ammour Personal Carrier (APC) and a gun truck. According to a member of the Civilian Joint Task Force (JTF), Hamidu Abu, the deadly group targeted soldiers camp but not residents. He added that the base was razed down as several valuables were stolen by the assailants. “They came at about 4pm and due to the sand storms, it was difficult for soldiers to repel them. They burnt down the base including APC and four other vehicles. “I can’t ascertain if there was any causality figure,” Abu said.
