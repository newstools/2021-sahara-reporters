A lady on Instagram, @cammyashlove has warned that Nigerians should be vigilant and alert as there are kidnappers and ritualists on the prowl. The lady, who took to her Instagram handle on Wednesday, posted videos of another lady who had been attacked and battered by the alleged ritualists.  She further explained how her friend was kidnapped on Sunday from a taxi she had boarded, stabbed brutally but luckily escaped through the car window. Her post reads, “'This happened to my friend @teelove.i. On her way to Lekki at about 8 pm yesterday(13/06/2021) her @bolt_nigeria driver was double-crossed, the rider was stabbed and they took my friend in their car (black Toyota Matrix). “One of the kidnappers started pressing her breast inside the car, telling the other one her breast is too small, for what they need it for then she started dragging with them and they started stabbing her. “But thank God she escaped via the car window, please guys let’s be safe out there. This country has failed us, going out and coming in safely is underrated. The government has failed us.” A post shared by Cammy (@cammyashlovee)
