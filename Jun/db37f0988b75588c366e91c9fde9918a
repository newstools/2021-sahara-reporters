A fresh crisis has engulfed the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) as the outgoing President of the Association, Comrade Danielson Bamidele Akpan has fixed a new date to elect new national executives members. According to a statement by the Chairman of the Convention Planning Committee, Comrade Olajide Wolimoh, the association noted that the convention would take place at the Benue State University, Makurdi between 24th and 26th June, 2021.  The statement also added that the invitation letter has been addressed to all members, including the outgoing SUG Presidents and stakeholders. Akpan urged all aspirants to consult widely as that alone will guarantee their successes at the election. He used the opportunity to debunk speculations that he has transited to a new leadership led by one Sunday Asefon.  “I was duly elected by vast majority of Nigerian students and nobody can take it through the barrel of the guns. Propaganda and blackmail to acquire power and destroy people has proven to be a wrong approach world over and must be discouraged. “Though frost with factionalism, NANS has remained an umbrella body of all Nigerian Students across the globe,” he said. Comrade Adamu Abubakar, a students’ union President in a Northern university in the country expressed excitement over the development. "Now Nigerian students can elect their own leaders, and not one governor - imposed President. “Since democracy is about government of the people, for the people and by the people, a leadership known already to be partisan cannot defend students and the overall interest of the populace. This is what NANS is known for,” he said. A faction in the association had in December 2020 announced Asefon as its new President amid chaos and violence that characterised its convention at the old parade ground, Abuja. Asefon, a civil servant with the Ekiti State Government, got 155 votes to defeat his closest rival, Olushola Oladoja, who scored 100 votes.
