A member of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), Stanley Osinachi has disclosed that their supporters abroad fund their operations. He also disclosed that their charms were prepared by Aguleri native doctors in Anambra State.  ESN is the militant arm of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which the Nigerian government insists has been proscribed. “It is our people from abroad that send money to us through Dragon. It is Dragon that will go and collect the money and bring it for our feeding and other needs.” Stanley, who  is one of the suspected members of ESN that attacked Owerri in the early hours of Sunday, revealed this at the Imo police command in Owerri, where he was paraded alongside the lifeless bodies of his suspected gang members. The suspected gang members were killed during a shoot-out between the ESN and special forces. Stanley said, “Dragon recruited me by calling me on the phone to join the Eastern Security Network, ESN, I was recruited for the past three days. Even when I wanted to leave he said he would kill me. Our camp is at Akabo in Ikeduru local government area, that is where we normally operate from and plan for our operation and Dragon told us that part of our plan is to be killing and burning police stations. “Policemen got me when we came out as early as 4am to attack Owerri, we are more than 7 in number, coming to attack and five of us were killed by the police. I am the only person that survived. I want to tell you that in our camp, it is only Dragon that wears military uniform and our charms are prepared at Aguleri in Anambra state. My arrest came in God’s time everything that happens is according to God’s wish.” “Dragon tells us to kill police people and collect their guns for us to use it for operation. We even kidnapped a policewoman, an officer, and kept her in our custody so that she will be giving us information.”
