Former Imo State Governor and Senator Representing Imo West District, Rochas Okorocha, has cautioned the South-East Over its agitations for Nigeria’s breakup. Okorocha warned that Igbos would be the worst hit if Nigeria breaks up. @REALROCHAS/TWITTER The former Imo State Governor spoke in Abuja while addressing some women groups yesterday. Okorocha stressed that the South-East should push towards fixing the country and not its disintegration. The lawmaker stressed that Igbos are nationalistic in nature, hence they should dismiss the urge for Nigeria’s disintegration. He said, “It is only an Igbo man that goes to a place and remains put in that place, buys a land and builds a house for his family without feeling insecure. The Igbos will lose more if Nigeria divides. “Most Nigerian leaders who were successful had one thing or the other to do with the Igbos. It is either they married Igbo women or had some links with them. I can call names like former President, (Olusegun) Obasanjo; former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, Buba Marwa, just to name a few”. There have been continuous agitations in the region with groups such as the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, and the Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereignty State of Biafra, MASSOB, working towards the disintegration of Nigeria and creation of new republics. IPOB led by Nnamdi Kanu has been in the forefront, calling for Biafra’s actualisation.
