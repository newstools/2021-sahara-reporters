The UN worker was abducted by the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) faction of Boko Haram on Maiduguri/Damaturu highway about five months ago.  The insurgents had attacked a convoy of travellers close to Matari village between Mainok to Jakana along the Maiduguri/Damaturu highway, where Garba was abducted on Saturday, January 2.  The insurgents, dressed in military uniforms, placed a roadblock on the highway with three Hilux vans and motorcycles.  Idris caught the attention of the insurgents when he attempted to throw away his identification card.  A businessman, Muazu Bawa, who was also released, was in his private vehicle and ran over the Boko Haram checkpoint but his car was shot from behind before the insurgents whisked him away.  Executive Director of Yobe State Network of Civil Society, Abubakar Baba Shehu, who also confirmed the release, prayed for more captives to be freed.  “I was together with someone who called a family member of Garba and he has confirmed the release of his brother. This is encouraging news and we pray that more captives should be released soon,” Shehu said.  Meanwhile, friends of the freed captives have taken to Facebook and other social media platforms to celebrate the release of their friends from Boko haram captivity.
