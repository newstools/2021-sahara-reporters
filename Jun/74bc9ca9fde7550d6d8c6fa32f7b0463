Former President Goodluck Jonathan's son-in-law, Prince Godswill Edward, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP and defected to the All Progressives Congress, APC.  Edward popularly called Prince 7 decamped to the ruling party together with a multitude of his supporters at Usumutong/Abeugo council ward in Abi Local Government Area of Cross River state on Wednesday, June 9  The Director General of the Conference of APC Support Groups, Comrade Obidike Chukwuebuka, who was present at the defection ceremony congratulated Prince Edward on his decision to abandon PDP.  Obidike described his move as a victory for the All Progressives Party (APC) in the South-South part of Nigeria and a plausible confirmation of President Buhari’s unflinching leadership style.  “Our president has yet again been vindicated by the crucial entry of key political figureheads in Cross River state that our president has the popular support and hearts of the Nigerian people, especially those of the South South." Obidike said.  On May 20, the governor, Ben Ayade, also dumped the PDP for the APC.  Ayade announced his decision at the Executive Council chambers of the Governor’s Office in Calabar.  The governor had earlier met with some APC chieftains, brewing suspicions of a likely defection.  It was learnt that APC National Caretaker, Governor Mai Mala Buni; Governors Kayode Fayemi and Hope Uzodinma of Ekiti and Imo states respectively as well as the Minister for State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, were among those said to be present.
