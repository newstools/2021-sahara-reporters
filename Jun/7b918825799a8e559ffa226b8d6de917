The Benue State Police Command has said its operatives in the early hours of Sunday killed 14 bandits during a gun battle to repel the attackers from freeing detainees at a police cell in the Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of the State. According to Daily Trust, the incident was the first attempt on a police facility in the state since the wake of similar attacks carried out in some states of the country.

The Police Public Relations Officer of the state command, DSP Catherine Anene, in a statement made available to newsmen in Makurdi, noted that a large number of bandits attempted to rescue their colleagues from police custody on Sunday morning. She said the foiled attempt followed a series of security operations going on in the Kastina-Ala area of the state during which some bandits were arrested and held in police custody. “These activities are geared towards a total clampdown on bandits activities in the area. “On 19th June 2021, five bandits were arrested and detained at Katsina-Ala Police Division for investigation and prosecution. “On 20th June 2021 at about 1:30 am more than 50 other gang members of the detainees mobilised and invaded the police station to rescue their counterparts. “Officers at the division, who were already at alert, engaged them in a gun duel and were able to subdue the bandits. “Fourteen (14) of them were brought down during the exchange of fire while several others escaped with gunshot injuries,” Anene stated. The PPRO added that operatives in the area are currently on the trail of suspects at large just as she urged the residents of Kastina-Ala town to remain calm and avail the police of information about the bandits.
