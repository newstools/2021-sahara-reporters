Jamiu Abiola, one of the children of the winner of the June 12, 1993, presidential election, the late Chief MKO Abiola, has said it is painful to the family that the Nigerian government has yet to bring the killers of his mother, Kudirat Abiola, to book. Jamiu, however, urged Nigerians to continue to remember June 12 as the sacrifices of democracy and to celebrate hope.  He stated these in an interview with Daily Trust, adding that the tensions around June 12, 1993, were also the same agitations around the country today. Jamiu said, "It has not been easy. We have grown up, but that void (of my parents) can never be filled. What makes it more difficult is that the killers have not been brought to book. It is frustrating. It shows that there is a big problem in our justice system. "We will continue to celebrate hope. What democracy means is that things can get better if we put in the effort. I pray we all understand that someday. Democracy needs adequate input from those who govern and the governed to be prosperous. "The best way to address these agitations is through dialogue and patriotism. People should bear in mind that every country has problems, but the will to tackle them can only originate from patriotism." Reliving his experiences with his mother, Kudirat, Jamiu added, "There is no way you can be prejudiced against other tribes after growing up in a place like Sabon Gari, Zaria (Kaduna State). "As far back as when I was a kid, I noticed that she had friends from just about every corner of the country and that she felt equally at home with each one of them. She also hardly ever generalised when describing people from other ethnic groups."
