Olayomi Koiki, media aide to popular Yoruba freedom fighter, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho has debunked claims that the Yoruba Nation Now rally scheduled for Saturday in Lagos state, was cancelled. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Koiki stated that the rumour in some quarters that Igboho had cancelled the rally, was a lie. Sunday Igboho According to him, Igboho cannot singlehandedly cancel the rally. He, however, called on the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, to mobilise his men to protect agitators who are coming into Lagos on Saturday from unruly people who want to destabilise the rally. The statement read, ”This is to confirm to the general public that the Lagos State Mega Rally scheduled for this Saturday, 3rd of July 2021 will hold as planned. “We are using this medium to ask the CP (Commissioner of Police) Lagos State to protect all the Yorubas coming into the state for this peaceful Mega Rally because of all the information about some individuals and group of people trying to disrupt the peaceful rally. “Chief Sunday Igboho cannot stop this rally because it’s all the Yorubas that want the rally to hold and the Yoruba Nation is bigger than him. “Rally holds at Ojota and it starts at 9 am."
