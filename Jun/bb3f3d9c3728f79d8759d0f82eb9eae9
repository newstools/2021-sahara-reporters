The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) has reacted to the re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. The National President of the group, Yerima Shettima, on Tuesday, said the Nigerian government and the court should ensure that Kanu, whom he referred to as a 'common criminal' should face the 'music' for his actions. IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu In a report by Daily Post, Shettima also described Kanu’s re-arrest as long overdue. He lauded the effort of the Nigerian government and security agents at re-arresting Kanu since he had left the country. The AYCF National President also urged the people of the South-East never to allow people like Kanu to speak for them again. Shettima said, “Finally Nnamdi Kanu has been brought back home. We must commend the Nigerian government, Interpol for their wonderful work. “They have demonstrated that it’s a matter of time, though long overdue at least, it’s better late than never. “Finally, he has to face the music probably, and I’m sure this will serve as a lesson to our brothers in the South-East that never again should they fold their hands and allow a common criminal to be talking as if he speaks for them out of fear. “I’m sure the judiciary would do the needful and ensure he faces the proper music so that at the end of the day, it will serve as a deterrent to the likes of him that may want to think or behave the way this mad man has done over time.”
