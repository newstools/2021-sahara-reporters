President Muhammadu Buhari has said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will remain in power as long as possible. Buhari said this on Friday during an interview with the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA).  “We are doing all we can to make the APC to be in power for as long as possible. “That is why we carried out the revalidation exercise. From state to state; local government to local government and ward by ward,” he said. Buhari also vowed to abide by the constitution and not stay in office beyond his tenure.
