President Muhammadu Buhari says those who want to destroy his government will receive the shock of their lives as his administration will do everything possible to ensure they fail.  Buhari disclosed this on Tuesday after he received a briefing from the chairman of Independent National Electoral Commission, Mahmood Yakubu; and other electoral commissioners. The president said the sponsors and orchestrators of insecurity in the country are doing so because they want his administration to fail. According to him, his government will get “harder” on those hellbent on destroying Nigeria.
