Okogie added that Buhari has made the country a “living hell for Nigerians” while describing the government’s inability to respond to the worsening economic and political situation in Nigeria as worrisome.  According to him, Nigeria is currently worse than Buhari met it in 2015 when he assumed power.  The former Catholic Archbishop stated this in a statement he issued on Monday titled, “Cardinal Okogie: Life at 85.”  Okogie said after failing and refusing to accept responsibility, the Nigerian Government was clamping down on Twitter and Nigerians using the micro-blogging site.  Okogie urged the Buhari administration to retrace its steps to avoid anarchy. He also berated the Buhari-led administration over its ban of Twitter in Nigeria.  The statement partly reads, “A country fails when instead of reassuring its citizens by actions and policies that the future is secure, it becomes a case of most people planning to flee the country to other climes where their governments are truly functioning. Such is practically our case today. One whose house is on fire should not take to the streets dancing.  “While it is true that our problems did not start under this administration, they seem to have worsened economically and politically in these past six years.  “The sad part is that there is no articulate coordinated response from the government to stem these downward trends, apart from the usual ‘playing the ostrich’ and throwing tantrums when they are criticised, like the rather hasty suspension of Twitter.”
