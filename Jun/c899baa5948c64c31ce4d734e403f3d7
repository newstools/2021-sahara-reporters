They demanded a ransom of 2 million naira. They even sent her nudes (nude pictures) to us. “And she also sent voice notes saying we should start sending money into her account that they've told her that as long as they start seeing (bank) alert, she will remain alive; if not, she will die. “At first, the kidnappers gave us Monday as the deadline but we reminded them that there's a holiday on Monday.
