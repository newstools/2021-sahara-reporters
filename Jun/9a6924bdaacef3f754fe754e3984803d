The Department of State Services (DSS) has released an Islamic singer, Ahmad Abdul, arrested for releasing a blasphemous song. Abdul was arrested for releasing the uncensored song titled ‘Barhama Gwaska’, perceived as blasphemous and capable of creating chaos in the state.  The DSS had said it took the singer into protective custody to avert likely violent reactions against him from Kano residents. While in detention, Abdul tendered an apology to the entire Muslim community, Kano state government, and Islamic scholars. He told the DSS that he did not realise that the song violated Islamic teachings. Confirming the release on Monday, the Executive Secretary of Kano State Films and Video Censorship Board, Ismaila Na’abba Afakallah, said he had received hundreds of petitions against the song from concerned citizens. Afakallah said he reported the singer to the DSS which later arrested him at a hotel where he had been hiding for days to save him from the mob. He added that the singer was reunited with his family after spending days in custody. “He has been released as he regretted and apologised over his offence, promising not to repeat it,” said Afakallah. Last August, an upper Sharia court in the Hausawa Filin Hockey area of the state had found another singer, Yahaya Sharif-Aminu, guilty of blasphemy and sentenced him to death for a song he circulated via WhatsApp. However, the appellate division of the High Court of Kano State on January 21quashed the death sentence and freed the singer.
