The Oyo State government has announced 25 per cent reduction in the tuition of students of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH). Governor Seyi Makinde made this known on Tuesday while paying a visit to the students of the institution.  Makinde said the reduction was done despite the fact that the LAUTECH tuition was the lowest in the entire South-West. He added that the reduction will cut across the board. He said he had fulfilled the promises he had made to the students during electioneering having fixed the Under G Road and actualised the sole ownership of LAUTECH for Oyo state. â€œLet me tell you, the LAUTECH fee is still the lowest in the entire South-West. Having said that, I will reduce your fee across the board; whether indigenes or non-indigenes, even new students. There will be a reduction of 25 per cent across board," he said.
