Unknown gunmen have attacked Kofar Gayan and Kofar Kona areas of Zaria and abducted no less than 12 residents from their homes. This comes two days after an attack onÂ  Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, Zaria, Kaduna state.  The Police Public Relations Officer, Kaduna State Command, ASP Mohammed Jalige, who confirmed the incident, said he was trying to gather details to update the press. However, an official of Kaduna State Vigilance Service said the incident occurred between 12.01 and 1.00 am on Saturday, NAN reports. The official, who did not give details on the exact number of people abducted by the kidnappers, said the incident occurred around Government Girls Secondary School, Kofar Gayan. According to another witness, Abdullahi Mohammed, who is also a resident of the area, no fewer than 12 people were abducted during the operation. He said about eight people were kidnapped from one house, while others were picked separately. Similarly, a daughter of one of the victims, Hafsat Kusfa, claimed the bandits broke into their home around 12.01 am and assembled the victims in front of the house. She said the bandits, who were about seven in number, armed with guns and machetes, took away eight members of her family, including her father, mother, sisters and brothers. Kusfa said her father and mother, as well as some of the kidnapped victims, were later released through the efforts of security men who intercepted the hoodlums. Barely two days ago, a similar incident occurred at Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, Zaria, where one student was killed, while two lecturers and eight students were abducted.
