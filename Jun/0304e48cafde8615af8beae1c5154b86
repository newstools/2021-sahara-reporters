The Nigerian Army said on Wednesday that its troops conducted clearance operations against bandits and kidnappers in Kano State, but no arrest was made. The army’s Director of Public Relations, Brig Gen Mohammed Yerima, said in a release that the troops were at the notorious Falgore Forest where they blocked the route of the bandits and kidnappers terrorising the North-West region.

Yerima said, “Nigerian Army troops in a bid to ensure the return of socio-economic activities which were hitherto hampered by activities of bandits and other criminal elements, 1 Division NA in conjunction with personnel of Nigeria Police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps as well as local vigilantes and hunters embarked on a special joint clearance operation in Falgore Forest and other flash points in Kano State. “The clearance operation which is still ongoing is geared towards complementing the efforts of the standby troops at Forward Operating Base Falgore, with the ultimate aim of making sure that bandits, kidnappers and other criminal elements from neighbouring states do not infiltrate into the forest and any other part of Kano State to carry out their nefarious activities. “Consequently, we wish to reassure the good people of Kano State of the safety of their lives and property and also urge them to continue to report suspicious movements of strange individuals or groups in their vicinity to the nearest security agency for prompt action. “The NA in close cooperation with all the stakeholders on security is determined to ensure full return to normalcy in Kano State and other adjoining states in order to enable law-abiding citizens go about their normal businesses without harassment by criminal elements.”
