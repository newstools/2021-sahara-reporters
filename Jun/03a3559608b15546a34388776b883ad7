Former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has been suspended from the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, for allegedly engaging in anti-party activities.  Soludo was suspended on Wednesday by the National Executive Committee (NEC), which is the second highest decision making body of the party, after ratifying the resolution of National Working Committee (NWC) of the party.  The National Executive Committee acted under the Jude Okeke-led faction.  The National Working Committee of the party had previously met on Tuesday where the decision to suspend Soludo was met, Daily Trust reports.  Meanwhile, the suspension of the former governorship aspirant in Anambra State from the party, has further intensified the crisis within the party. The party's Acting National Publicity Secretary in Abuja, Comrade Ikechukwu Chukwunyere, said, "The party is ready for the July 1 primary election and the winner will lead APGA to victory at the November 6, 2021 governorship election.”  The Okeke-led faction described the governorship primary election held in Awka, the Anambra state capital, by the Victor Oye- led faction as a sham and effort in futility.   “The NWC of APGA has resolved to suspend former governor of Central Bank of Nigeria and governorship aspirant, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo from the party for anti-party activities,” he said.
