The Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has taken a swipe at presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, for being silent on the recent attack on Igangan residents in Oyo State by suspected Fulani herders. According to him, Shehu would have been the first to issue a statement condemning such a heinous act if Northerners had been victims of the attack. Gani Adams Media Aide to Adams, Kehinde Aderemi, stated this on Wednesday while talking to The PUNCH. SaharaReporters had reported how suspected Fulani herders stormed the community in their numbers to kill, maim and burn. About 15 persons were reportedly killed during the attack while the Palace of Asigangan of Igangan was also burnt. Speaking on the silence of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to the attack, Aderemi said, â€œIt is very clear that the Federal Government is not even ready to issue any statement regarding the attack. The Federal Government would be the first to condemn such an attack if it had happened in the North or affected Northerners but Garba Shehu as he is, we know where he is coming from, so, we are not expecting any miracle from him. As Aare said in a previous statement, those that perpetrated the act are beating the drum of war in the country. "Those killed in Igangan town have their families and friends, there is blood flowing in their veins and in a moment their lives were cut short by killer herdsmen and bandits in their home."
