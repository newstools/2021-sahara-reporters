The Nigerian Government has said it has arrested the leader of the proscribed Indegenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu. The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, made the disclosure to journalists on Tuesday, saying Kanu was arrested and brought to Nigeria on Sunday. SaharaReporters Media He said the arrest followed a collaborative effort between security agencies in Nigeria and the Interpol, Vanguard reports. Malami further disclosed that Kanu would be taken before the Federal High Court in Abuja for continuation of his trial on charges bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, unlawful possession of firearms and management of an unlawful society. Kanu was on trial in Nigeria before jumping bail and fleeing to Jerusalem. The Nigerian government had charged him with treason but Binta Nyako, a judge of the federal high court in Abuja, had granted him bail after 18 months in detention. Kanu had flouted all the terms of the bail before the military invaded his Abia residence on September 14, 2017. He fled afterwards and resurfaced in Jerusalem on Friday In a broadcast via Radio Biafra, Kanu boasted that the Nigerian court lacks the capacity to try him, describing the court as a Kangaroo court. He said the judge who asked his sureties to produce him should have asked the army why they invaded his residence. “Nigerian court is a Kangaroo court. I did not jump bail, I left because the court failed to protect me,” he said.
