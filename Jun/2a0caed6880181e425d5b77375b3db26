The National Association of Polytechnic Students (NAPS) has asked members of the association to join the nationwide protest slated for tomorrow, June 12 in honour of students of Nuhu Bamali Polytechnic, Kaduna state, abducted by bandits. Some gunmen had on Thursday night invaded the institution in the Zaria Local Government Area of the state, abducting eight students and two lecturers.  SaharaReporters gathered that a student was also killed while others sustained injuries during the attack. The abducted lecturers are identified as Habila Nasai from the General Studies Department and Adamu Shehu Shika from the Accounting Department. Speaking to SaharaReporters on Friday, NAPS Vice President, National Affairs, Olalekan Olayinka Ayeni urged students to ignore a statement credited to the President of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Sunday Asefon and participate in the planned protest. “It’s so sad that Asefon could call for the cancellation of the planned June 12 protest against insecurity in the country a day after some of our colleagues in Nuhu Bamali Polytechnic were abducted. “We hereby called on Nigerian students to participate fully in the planned rally in honour of our colleagues who are still in captivity.” Civil society organisations and human rights activists have called for a nationwide protest on June 12 against the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration. According to some publicity posters, the protest will make 14 critical demands which are: Abolish 1999 constitution, End terrorism, End banditry, Isa Pantami must go (Minister of Communications and Digital Economy who expressed sympathy for terrorists), Free all detained activists, End insecurity, Justice for all EndSARS victims, Free Kogi2 (Two anti-President Muhammadu Buhari protesters – Larry Emmanuel and Victor Anene Udoka – who are being detained in Kogi State), Buhari Must Go, Revert electricity tariffs, End ASUP (Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics) strike, Revert fuel price, Revert party deregistration, and Free Nicholas Mbah.
