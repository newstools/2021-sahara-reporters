The Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has urged that the minimum age for marriage in the country should be 18 years, to protect underage citizens from early marriage and abuse. CAN President, Olasupo Ayokunle made this known at the ongoing public hearing organised by the House of Representatives Special Committee On The Review Of The Constitution in Akure, Ondo State capital.

The Christian body also solicited for the the rights of females to contest or seek appointment to be based on equal opportunities that secure their active participation in politics. “It should be made a law that anybody below the age of 18 is not mature enough for marriage across the nation. That’s the submission. “We recommend that the constitution shall bring clarity and emphasis to recognising and affirming 18 years as the age of maturity and that for sexual consent. “Guarantee for the rights of women and girls, females, to contest or seek appointment based on equal opportunities that secure their active participation in politics.”
