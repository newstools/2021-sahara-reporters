Members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), otherwise known as Park Management System (PMS) are currently clashing with a rival group in the Iwo Road area of Ibadan, the Oyo state capital. SaharaReporters gathered that one person has been killed by the transport workers in the crisis currently going on there. SaharaReporters Media SaharaReporters on Tuesday reported that the NURTW and PMS members engaged in a fracas, which led to the death of two people in the Agugu Oremeji-Agugu area of Ibadan. A resident of the area who sent a video of the incident to our correspondent said, "It is for real. That video has said it all. Tell our people to avoid Iwo Road now. It is serious, my brother. One person has been killed already. It is in that video," he said. The current chairman of the PMS, Mukaila Lamidi, popularly called Auxiliary was sent to jail in 2017 for killing the National President of the Nigeria Medical Students’ Association (NIMSA), Mr. Auwal Shanono. Auwal was returning from Ife after attending a National Conference on preventing maternal mortality. He stopped over at Iwo Road, Ibadan to board a night bus to Kaduna with a group of other students when they were caught between warring factions of the NURTW led by Auxiliary in Ibadan. Until his death, Auwal was a 500 level medical student at the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. After returning from prison, Makinde appointed him as the chairman of the PMS, which generated a lot of controversy in Ibadan. Efforts to get the reaction of the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Adewale Osifeso were not successful as he did not answer his calls or reply the text message sent to him.
