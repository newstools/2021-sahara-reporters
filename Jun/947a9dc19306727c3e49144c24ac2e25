The Ondo State High Court sitting at the Olokuta Medium Prison in Akure has granted bail to Kemisola Ogunniyi, an 18-year-old girl detained over #EndSARS protest who birthed a baby at the Surulere Prison in Ondo town, Ondo East Local Government Area of the state.  Justice Omolara Adejumo granted Kemisola bail in the sum of 10 million naira and a surety in like sum. The judge ordered prison authorities to bring Kemisola and her newborn as a prelude to releasing her from prison. She recently birthed the baby at the Surulere Prison in Ondo town, Ondo East Local Government Area of the state. SaharaReporters learnt that a court bailiff, prison warden, and lawyers are to proceed to Surulere prison in Ondo town to bring her to court as a prelude to releasing her. Also, counsel will move bail motion for three others arrested over the alleged #EndSARS protest, who are still in prison. Kemisola was arrested in Akure and has been imprisoned since October 24, 2020, while going to a pharmacy to buy drugs for her mother. But she was arrested by the police with three others who said they were part of the participants of the #EndSARS protest in the state. The police claimed they were one of those #EndSARS protesters who burnt the office of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state last year, about eight months ago. The three others are Ayodele Bukunmi, Ojo Samuel and Ani Obinna. The charges preferred against them were conspiracy to commit the following felonies, to wit: arson, riotous assembly, stealing and malicious damage. Kemisola was said to have gone into labour on June 15 and gave birth to a baby boy the following day. Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, had in a Facebook post last week called on Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the state to look into the issue, adding that the mother of the newborn was innocent and never committed any offence. The post by Sowore triggered public outrage, with many Nigerians demanding her swift and unconditional release from detention.
