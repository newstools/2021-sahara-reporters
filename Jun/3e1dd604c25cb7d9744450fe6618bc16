The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has again released a prophecy regarding the security situation in the country. Ayodele, who issued the prophecy on Monday, warned against a bomb attack in Abuja while urging the Nigerian Army and Department of State Services (DSS) to protect Nigeria’s porous borders.  The clergyman says he foresees an attack on the country by some external forces, hence called on the DSS, the Nigerian Army and other security agents to fortify Nigeria’s borders. In a statement, the cleric stated that if the attack of the external forces is successful, it will affect the already deteriorating security architecture of the country more. He also called on the Nigerian government to provide the necessary weapons and equipment needed to fortify the security at the borders, Daily Post reports. He said: ‘’Nigerian government must work on the security of their borders because I foresee external forces striking over there. The Nigerian Army, DSS, Police should protect the borders at all cost because of these external forces.“I foresee external forces attacking Nigerian borders which will affect security in the country. Abuja should be secured against bombings.’’
