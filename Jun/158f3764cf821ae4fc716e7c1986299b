The United Arab Emirates flagship carrier, Emirates has again announced indefinite suspension of flights to Nigeria. “In line with government directives, passenger flights to and from Nigeria (Lagos and Abuja) are suspended with effect from 21 June 2021 until further notice,” Emirates said in a statement posted on its website.  “Customers travelling to and from Lagos and Abuja will not be accepted for travel. Customers who have been to or connected through Nigeria in the last 14 days are not permitted to board from any other point to the UAE.” The Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management in Dubai had on Saturday eased travel rules for inbound passengers arriving from India, South Africa and Nigeria. The UAE authorities also fixed Wednesday, June 23, 2021, for resumption of flights to the countries. “We regret the inconvenience caused, and affected customers should contact their booking agent or Emirates call centre for rebooking. Emirates remains committed to Nigeria, and we look forward to resuming passenger services when conditions allow,” Emirates continued.
