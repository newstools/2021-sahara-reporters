12 Hours Ago The fighters were said to have stormed the area in 10 utility vehicles, and burnt down one Ammour Personal Carrier (APC) and a gun truck. According to a member of the Civilian Joint Task Force (JTF), Hamidu Abu, the deadly group targeted soldiers camp but not residents. He added that the base was razed down as several valuables were stolen by the assailants. The attack comes two days to the planned visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to the State, which is the epicentre of insurgency war in Nigeria. Ahead of his election in 2015, Buhari had promised to defeat Boko Haram but six years into his government, that promise has not been fulfilled. In February 2020, residents of the state booed the President as his convoy drove in and when it was leaving Maiduguri, state capital, during a condolence visit. The residents were heard shouting in Hausa “Bama so, ka samu a kunya.” Meaning “We don’t want you, because you have disappointed us.” Thursday will be the first time the President will visit Borno since the February 2020 incident.
