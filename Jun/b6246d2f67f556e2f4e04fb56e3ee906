Mixed reactions have trailed the report on the arrest of the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu by the Nigerian Government. On Tuesday, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, informed journalists that Kanu was arrested and brought to Nigeria on Sunday.  He said the arrest followed a collaborative effort between security agencies in Nigeria and Interpol. Malami further disclosed that Kanu would be taken before the Federal High Court in Abuja for the continuation of his trial on charges bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, unlawful possession of firearms, and management of an unlawful society. But Nigerians on social media have kicked against Kanu's arrest, noting that there are more serious security threats that should be tackled. Many noted that banditry and terrorism remained the order of the day in the North, without any tangible effort by the government to arrest the leaders of the gangs of bandits wreaking havoc. Social media users also condemned Kanu's arrest on the premise that Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi had not been arrested despite his alleged ties with bandits. While many have found the report incredible, some sets of persons have instead lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for keeping to his promise of dealing with terrorists. Below are some reactions:  Freedom isnât free. Even if it means that we pay with our blood for our children and their children to live free from the excesses of the Fulani savagery then so be it.   When will they arest the spokeman of Bandits? Gumi   FG should get ready for what is coming on them. We are are IPOB and not cowards like @Mbuhari and Fulani's.   So FG can go through the pain of arresting Nnamdi Kanu abroad but canât arrest Boko Haram & bandits who kill innocent Nigerians daily?   He must be kept alive because southerners cannot die for Buhari to reign.   With this arrest it shows that FG can arrest those bandits and kidnappers from their hiding place but FG chose not to   So Buhari left Boko Haram, ISWAP, bandits and herdsmen to go after Nnamdi Kanu?Is he the cause of insecurity and poverty in Nigeria?   Yusuf was killed, did that stop Boko Haram? The government must tackle the issues that Kanu speaks about. Marginalization, inequality, restructuring. Government should not make Kanu the case and abandon the real case.   It took the effort of ISWAP to kill Abubakar Shekau. I fear for what the Buhari's government is about to create   It's painful that this may be the end of Nnamdi Kanu.FG will just abandon him there and keep post-poning and adjourning until he has no more strength left in him to fight.  A Facebook user, David Ologun said, “The best way the federal government can douse the tension and gain the support of Nigerians is to hold dialogue with him and release him to go and calm the south-east. There is no point jailing him if agitation must end in the southeast.” Another user, Victor Emeka wrote, “It changes nothing. Biafra is bigger than Nnamdi Kanu. He played his role in waking up the awareness. Just like no one can kill Sharia ideology, that is the same with Biafra unless you come out with a better reason why Igbos will do better in Nigeria than Biafra. “It does not change the fact that Nigeria is a zoo and failed state and more than 80 percent of abokis cannot travel to their villages because of insecurity." Glimpse Godspower Adenu posted, “Misplacement of priority. How is Kanu the problem of this country? Clueless and blind administration full of hate and nepotism.” Uwen Aron posted, “At the moment, arresting IPOB leader is never Nigeria problem than Nigeria it self problem (sic).” Anselm Qledibe stated, “It's not the first time they have arrested him, the government should tread with care, the country is too tensed.”
