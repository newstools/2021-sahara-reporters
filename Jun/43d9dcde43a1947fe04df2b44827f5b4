One of the inmates who escaped from Owerri Correctional Centre, Imo State, Oyemachi Maduabuchi, has been re-arrested in Lagos after allegedly stealing a SIM card and some memory cards. The suspect was one of the inmates who escaped from the Correctional Centre during a jailbreak on April 5, 2021. Vanguard Newspaper He was re-arrested by the Lagos State Police Command on April 23, 2021, Vanguard reports. Maduabuchi, who fled Owerri the same day, was said to have moved to his village, Fegge in Onitsha, Anambra State, to meet his mother who later linked him up with his elder sister, Amarachi Maduabuchi, a resident of Ijegun, Lagos who thereafter invited him to Lagos on April 19, 2021. He was said to have been kept in the sister’s house where she used to lead him to church for special deliverance programmes. In the process, after a vigil on April 20, 2021, at Bride Assembly Church, in the Ijesha area of Lagos State, the suspect allegedly stole the SIM card and memory cards of a member (name withheld) of the church before he was eventually arrested and the stolen items recovered from him. In the course of police investigation, it was revealed that the suspect had been standing trial since 2009 for conspiracy, armed robbery and arson before Justice Nna Amadi of Ngbidi High Court 1, at Ngbidi in Imo State. He has reportedly since confessed to the crime while the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, has directed that he should be handed over to the Nigerian Correctional Service for further investigation and necessary actions. The police boss, therefore, assured members of the public that the command would not relent in its effort to make the state safe and peaceful for all and sundry to live in.
