Students of Abraham Adesanya polytechnic (AAPOLY), Ijebu Igbo, Ogun state have accused the management of mandating new students to pay N7, 500 for matriculation gown, a N2, 500 increment from what was paid last year. “In 2017, students paid #3, 500, it was later increased to #5, 000 in 2018 and then increased to #7, 500 in 2021,” a student said.  Other students who spoke to SaharaReporters described the increment as outrageous and unfair. Bidemi Badmus, a National Diploma student of Accountancy, said the management is doing everything possible to milk students dry and equally making learning difficult "I’m a new student and I've been paying unnecessary payments since when I got admission. The management has decided to milk students dry without paying attention to the reality of the economy. Learning is now becoming difficult, I barely feed because of these payments. This is unfair, the management should consider us,” she said. James Babatunde, a student of Microbiology, said the management doesn't care about students' welfare but tries to implement laws that will force them to pay unnecessary fees. "The management doesn't care about us, we are suffering because of the unnecessary amounts of money we're asked to pay always. From one law to another, everything is aimed at extorting money from us, making it look legal and official," he said. SaharaReporters gathered that the management of the institution over the years have refused to disclose the breakdown of the school fees, hiked some fees and mandated students to make unnecessary payments. It was learnt that file collection was free not until 2019, when N6, 000 was attached as compulsory payment for it. Equally, the psychometric, key holder, school brochure and dome were enforced by the school management this year.
