Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa says has said agitators clamouring for the disintegration of Nigeria have not committed any crime. The lawmaker, on Tuesday, cautioned the military against the deployment of personnel to suppress agitations for secession. Lagos Assembly Speaker Mudashiru Obasa Obasa maintained that the use of force will not bear the desired result since it is part of democracy for citizens to speak out about leadership. He said although 22 years of unbroken democratic rule in Nigeria is worth celebrating, there are issues causing chaos in the country. The Speaker spoke during the debate on a motion on Nigeria’s democracy raised by Setonji David, Daily Post reports. The Assembly members advised the Nigerian Government to engage agitators across in a dialogue. “Those that elected have the right to protest when they think things are not working. The right to protest should not be taken away from them. “There is no crime in seeking for separate nations within an existing nation. Those representing the people through the ideology of social contract must listen,” Obasa added. Speaking on the ban on open grazing by herdsmen, he urged governors of Southern states to remain resolute in their decision. “Having stated their position, they should not go to sleep. They should follow it through. We will continue to call for state police and devolution of power,” he said. Obasa hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for signing an executive order granting autonomy to state legislature and judiciary and for honouring the late MKO Abiola with the declaration of June 12 as Democracy Day. The House observed a minute’s silence in honour of Abiola, winner of the 1993 presidential election, and all those who died in the course of the struggle.
