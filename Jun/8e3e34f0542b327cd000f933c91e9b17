SaharaReporters Media According to a source, some Fulani people attempted to kidnap the leader of traditionalists in the town but failed. The source, however, added that a butcher, popularly called Lamidi Eleran, who saw as the suspected Fulani herdsmen were trying to kidnap the man, was killed. His death, according to the source, led to a serious protest held in front of the house of a man known as Ade Master. But Ade Master was said to have shot one of the protesters. Ade master was also said to be one of those vying for the stool of Alajaawa in the town. SaharaReporters learnt that following the death of the protester, youths in the town took to streets and burnt all his properties, including his hotels in the town. A member of Odu'a Peoples Congress (OPC) in the town, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the incident to our correspondent. He said, "It is true. Ade Master, who is also vying for the kingship in the town caused the crisis. The story you heard is true. He has gone out of the town now. All his houses and hotels have been burnt. He killed a young man, for God's sake. Why must you kill an harmless protester?" he queried. Meanwhile, a young man was on Wednesday morning killed when some hoodlums in Bornphoto, Agbeni, and Gege areas of Ibadan, the state capital, clashed. Our correspondent gathered that the two factions that clashed were disciples of two notorious hoodlums recently killed in Ibadan.
