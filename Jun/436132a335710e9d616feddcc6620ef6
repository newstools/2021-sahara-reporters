The Ebonyi state commissioner for infrastructure development, Fidelis Nweze is dead. SaharaReporters gathered that Nweze died in a hospital in Abuja due to injuries he sustained in an auto crash earlier in the week. Fidelis Nweze “So hard to say Rest In Peace, Engr. Nweze Fidelis before his death was a Commissioner for Infrastructure and Concession (sic) to the Ebonyi State Governor. One of the best brains in the government,” a government official told SaharaReporters. Nweze’s death comes barely five weeks Uche Okah, the then Commissioner for Land and Housing in Ebonyi state died. Okah died on May 15 at a hospital in Abuja, where she was receiving treatment over an undisclosed illness.
