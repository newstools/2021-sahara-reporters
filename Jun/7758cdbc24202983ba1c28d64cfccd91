A former presidential candidate, Albert Ambrose Owuru, has dragged President Muhammadu Buhari before a Federal High Court in Abuja asking the court to declare his seat vacant. Owuruâ€™s move is coming two years after he vied for the same position with Buhari during the 2019 presidential election.  Owuru, a British-trained constitutional lawyer, called to the Nigerian Bar in 1982 wants the court to declare Buhari an unlawful president illegally occupying the presidential seat at the Aso Rock Villa. The plaintiff who contested on the platform of the Hope Democratic Party (HDD) is asking the court to declare him (Owuru) as the authentic winner of the poll. He is seeking an order of the court directing his immediate inauguration to take over from Buhari. In the suit, instituted on June 16, 2021, against President Buhari and two others, Owuru claimed that he won the February 16. 2019 Presidential debate and that his suit against Buhari at the Supreme Court was inconclusive due to some errors on the adjourned date. He sought a declaration by the Federal High Court declaring that he is entitled to serve out a tenure of four years after his formal inauguration. Among other reliefs, the HDP presidential candidate wants Buhari removed from office immediately and be compelled to refund all salaries, allowances and emoluments he collected while being in office as the President, unlawfully. Owuru pleaded with the court to give an order that salaries, allowances and emoluments be paid to him from May 29, 2019, till date when he ought to have been sworn in. The plaintiff further applied for an order of perpetual injunction restraining Buhari, the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from further organising and conducting any Presidential election in 2023 to enable him complete his four-years term when inaugurated. Meanwhile, no date has yet been fixed for the hearing of the suit.
