St. Gregory De Great Catholic Church, Ubahuekem, Ihiala in Anambra state has intervened to save Mrs Chioma Asomugha from undergoing a harmful widowhood practice under duress.  Asomugha had on Sunday alleged that the brothers of Charles, her late husband, said she must drink the water to prove that she was not responsible for her husband’s demise. Front view of a church

The Parish Priest of the church, Rev. Fr. Virginus Udemba, said it took the intervention of the church and leadership of the village to bring the situation under control for the burial to take place.  “We had a busy Sunday deliberating on the matter before we were able to achieve some peace, which enabled us to conduct the burial mass and interment this morning.  “During our meeting, we found out that the relatives, who wanted to enforce an ancient tradition on the widow contributed nothing toward Charles’ treatment, while he was ill.  “But thank God that we were able to talk sense into them and, at the end, both the widow and her husband’s brothers participated in the dust-to-dust ritual,” Udemba said.  He said the main task before the mediation team after the burial was to ensure that the future of the four children from the marriage did not suffer.
