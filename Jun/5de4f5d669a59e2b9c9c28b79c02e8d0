Workers of the Ogun State Fire Service can be seen using kegs to put water into their truck at a site where there was a fire outbreak in a viral video. A guy is heard laughing and speaking Yoruba in the background of the video obtained by SaharaReporters.  The guy says, "See Ogun State life, see Nigeria fire extinguisher. See huge fire, the gas has not exploded. Look at firefighters, haa! Ogun State, Haa Buhari, sai baba see our life. Look at firefighters just loading."

A fuel-laden tanker was descending the sloppy road in the area but its tank suddenly fell off and went up in flames. The explosion of the ill-fated truck that was reportedly carrying 33,000 litres of diesel when the incident happened, killed five persons on the spot and left two others injured.
