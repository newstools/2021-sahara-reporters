The founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, Prophet T. B. Joshua is dead but that did not stop hundreds of sick people from thronging the church on Sunday with the hope of getting healed, SaharaReporters gathered. Many were met with news of the death of the late televangelist, Prophet TB Joshua.  But despite knowing the cleric had died, they refused to leave, hoping for some miracle powers to be unleashed from the body of the deceased. Many also sought access to his body, saying they would go and raise him themselves from the dead. SaharaReporters observed that many members and visitors that usually visit the church premises were denied access on Sunday — an indication that there was no church service. Some other members of the church confirmed that there were diseased people in the Synagogue who were also awaiting healing and miracles. Church members were seen outside the premises worshipping God as many called for the barricade to be removed so they can go and raise him themselves. A woman screamed, “Papa, please rise up, your many children are out here waiting for you. Please rise up and come and address us. You are not dead! Many sick people are inside waiting for you to heal them. See this my leg here, I came so your word can touch this leg. You are not dead!" A visitor told SaharaReporters that she came all the way from South-East Nigeria to seek prayers at the church only to meet reports of his untimely death. She said, “I am not a member of this church, I had just arrived from the South-East to seek healing here. I came to a relative's house only to see this message, I had to rush down here.”
