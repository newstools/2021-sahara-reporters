Two persons were reportedly killed in Oremeji-Agugu area of Ibadan, the Oyo state capital, by members of Motor Park System (PMS), otherwise known as National Union of Road Transaport Workers (NURTW) on Monday night.  SaharaReporters learnt that the crisis started after a member of Motor Park System (PMS) killed a member of NURTW and a member of PMS was killed in a reprisal. File photo used to illustrate story Our correspondent reports that the governor of the state, Seyi Makinde on assumption of office proscribed NURTW and inaugurated PMS which made the union factionalized.  A resident of Agugu told SaharaReporters that he narrowly escaped the attack by the thugs on Monday evening while returning home.  The source said some of the factional transport workers were also injured.  "Don't mention my name in your report. I was in Sango to see my grandchildren. On my way back home, I saw those people attacking one another. I saw two bodies were already on the ground. I had to run very fast after I got down from the bike that took me there.  "They have started again today. Those guys are members of NURTW. I don't know how we got to this stage. My bike man (commercial motorcyclist, popularly called okada man) was almost cut with a weapon yesterday. Though we don't know the genesis of the crisis, I heard it was between members of Park Manager System and NURTW. One of the NURTW was killed by PMS and in retaliation, the NURTW also mobilised to attack PMS.  "It is better for the police and Amotekun Corps to come to our rescue now. I am not sure I am going home today. The area is boiling as I speak with you," he said.
