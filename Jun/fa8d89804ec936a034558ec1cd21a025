A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Bode George has described as worrisome the silence of President Muhammadu Buhari on the recent attack by suspected Fulani herdsmen on Igangan, an agrarian community in Oyo State.  The former Deputy National Chairman of the PDP stated this in Lagos on Wednesday, in his State of the Nation’s address.  George noted that the Presidency is usually quick to release a statement each time there is such an attack in the country but that he was curious as to why it was different with the Igangan attack, in which about 15 residents were killed by the marauding attackers. He said, "President Muhammadu Buhari’s silence on the killings of people of Igangan community is dangerous and the fact that he is a Fulani man makes the matter worse. “I know his media aides to be very fast in reacting to issues but their silence on this particular incident is very suspicious." “The senseless killings, the cruel inhuman massacre of the Igangan natives in the Yoruba heartland by suspected herdsmen in the wee hours of last Sunday has brought the seething malady right to our doorsteps. No one is safe anymore. “I wonder, what hate, what evil, what madness will propel anyone of sane mind to plunge into the night with weapons of war, seeking out fellow citizens for pillage and murder? It puzzles rationality. It benumbs the senses. “The Igangan massacre is now a watershed in these ceaseless psychopathic killings that now pester our country without let. It will continue to haunt us all,” he said.
