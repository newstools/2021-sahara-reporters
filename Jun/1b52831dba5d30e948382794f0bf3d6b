Nigerian artiste, Eedris Abdulkareem, has described President Muhammadu Buhari as being bias towards northerners after the Presidency failed to speak on Saturday's attack on residents of Igangan in Oyo State. Abdulkareem also said northerners are angrier about the activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its militant arm, Eastern Security Network (ESN) in the South East than the Atrocities being n being carried out by Boko Haram terrorists and bandits in the region.  Posting on Instagram, Eedris Abdulkareem said Buhari has shown bias in his handling of insecurity in the country. He wrote, “48 hours after the terror unleashed on Iganagan, no word from Buhari, but if a cow is slaughtered, he will threaten the Igbos who know nothing about it. “Northerners are more angry with ESN/IPOB in the South-East than Boko Haram/bandits in the North.” SaharaReporters had reported on Sunday that gunmen suspected to be Fulani herders attacked Igangan, killing about 15 people and burning houses, including the palace of the monarch in the area, Asigangan of Igangan.
