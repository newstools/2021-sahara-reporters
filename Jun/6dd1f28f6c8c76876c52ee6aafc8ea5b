There was a shootout between security operatives attached to the convoy of Kano State Governor, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, and some armed bandits along Shema in Katsina State on their way back to Kano from Zamfara State. Although Ganduje was not in the convoy, it came under attack by bandits who blocked Zamfara, Katsina and Kano Road, around Shema on Tuesday, Vanguard reports. SaharaReporters Media Ganduje was in Zamfara to attend the formal defection of Governor Bello Matawale into the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). But after the event, Ganduje joined the Jigawa State Governor, Muhammadu Abubakar Badaru, back to Kano, which explains why he was not in his convoy. A source told Vanguard that Ganduje was not happy that his convoy did not fill their tanks for the return journey and he ordered them to proceed while he joined Badaru. However, on their way back to Kano, the convoy came under heavy gun attacks from the bandits, but was repealed by the security operatives attacked to the convoy. However, three police officers sustained minor bullet injuries, while the convoy ambulance was riddled with bullets. Another vehicle was said to have lost its tires after being hit by bullets. It however managed to drive to a safer place before the tires were changed.
