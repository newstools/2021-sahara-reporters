The African Action Congress (AAC) describes the suspension of the microblogging platform, Twitter as another embarrassing trend in the fascist posture of the Buhari regime. It’s actually exaggerated foolishness to seek to trample on people’s digital rights in this age of digitization. What is more embarrassing in the events that have played out in recent times is that while governments of other countries are working to position better on the global ranking of press freedom, the Buhari regime is seeking to break its own poor record of press and media rights violations.  We call on all Nigerians to resist the attempt by the regime to shamelessly stifle free speech and digital rights. AAC also calls on the Buhari regime to immediately suspend all moves to ban the microblogging platform that has expanded the space for civic engagements in Nigeria and to stop the “kangaroo  licensing” of OTT (Over-the-Top) and social media platforms which aim is to gag press and media freedom through the back-door. We call on Nigerians from all over the world to lace their boots, roll their sleeves and be ready to fight, as the illegal suspension of Twitter operations is just a preface to chapters of attacks on democracy that would be opened by the Buhari regime. We shall overcome! Signed: Femi Adeyeye National Publicity Secretary, African Action Congress 4/6/2021
