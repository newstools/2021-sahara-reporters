Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist group, has tried to take over the Nigerian Air Force base in Kaduna on Saturday morning. According to FIJ, an Air Force official said that as of 6 am on Saturday, a gunfight between the terrorists and military personnel that lasted for close to two hours was ongoing.

This attack comes two days after SaharaReporters reported how gunmen suspected to be bandits invaded the military barracks of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, Kaduna State, and carted away a herd of cattle. Though the exact number of the cattle stolen could not be determined, an eyewitness told SaharaReporters that the cows would not be less than a hundred in number based on previous experience. According to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons, the cattle were owned by Army officers. He, therefore, expressed shock that the barracks could be so porous for bandits to attack without any form of resistance. The source told SaharaReporters the first time it happened was last year and that about 400 cows were taken away by the bandits in what he described as a bloodless attack on the barracks. He, however, said some of the animals found their way back to their ranch.
