No fewer than 30 people were on Sunday night killed in renewed bandit attacks on two villages in Zamfara state. The affected villages were Askawa and Gidan Dannunu in the Zurmu Local Government Area of the state.  SaharaReporters gathered that the gunmen carted away sheep, cows and goats after burning barns as well as looting food items.  Deadly attacks have raged across Zamfara state where bandits have thrived.  Farming and herding communities in the state have long been terrorised by gangs who raid villages, steal cattle and kidnap residents for ransom. In 2019, the state government entered a peace agreement with gunmen. About 15 brand new Hilux vehicles and cash gifts were also given to leaders of different 'repentant' gangs of bandits by the governor in 2020. But despite all these, communities in the state are still being attacked and residents kidnapped and/or killed.
