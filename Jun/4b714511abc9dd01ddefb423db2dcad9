An international non-governmental organisation, Amnesty International has called on Nigerian government to respect the right of its citizens to hold peaceful protests. The group said this on Friday as Nigerians prepare for nationwide protest on Saturday, June 12 – Democracy Day.  According to some publicity posters, the protest will make 14 critical demands which are: abolish 1999 constitution, end terrorism, end banditry, (Isa) Pantami must go (Minister of Communications and Digital Economy who has expressed sympathy for terrorists), free all detained activists, end insecurity, justice for all EndSARS victims, Free Kogi2 (Two anti-President Muhammadu Buhari protesters – Larry Emmanuel and Victor Anene Udoka – who have been detained in Kogi State), Buhari Must Go, revert electricity tariffs, end ASUP (Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics) strike, revert fuel price, revert party deregistration, and free Nicholas Mbah. “Amnesty International is calling on the Nigerian authorities to respect the right to peaceful protest and ensure that Nigerians protesting tomorrow are allowed to peacefully exercise their right to freedom of assembly. Protest is not a crime. “Law enforcement agencies have a duty to facilitate people’s fundamental right to freedom of peaceful assembly, and to protect protesters,” Amnesty International said.
