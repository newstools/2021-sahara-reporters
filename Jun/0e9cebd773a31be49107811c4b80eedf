A lecturer in the Taraba State University, Umar Buba, has been released after spending four nights in the bandits' den. Umar who was kidnapped in the early hours of Sunday from the staff quarters of the university regained his freedom in the early hours of Thursday.  A family member disclosed this to Channels Television but did not specify if a ransom was paid to secure his release or not. His abduction and subsequent release makes it the third time that lecturers from the institution’s staff quarters will be kidnapped. Buba is a lecturer and Head of the Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management, Faculty of Agriculture in Taraba State University. The Vice-Chancellor of the school, Professor Vincent Ado-Tenebe Buba on Sunday said he would apply for licensed guns for his staff members to ensure their protection. He told journalists that the armed men fired gunshots sporadically to frighten security officials attached to the staff quarters before whisking away the lecturer.
