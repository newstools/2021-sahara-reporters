Emmanuel Thomas, a 500-level student of the Federal University of Technology, Minna in Niger State, has slumped and died a few weeks to his final examination. According to a student of the school, Thomas was going for a test when it started raining and he attempted to take cover at a building in the school before he suddenly slumped.  He said before the student could get help, he had passed on. The 25-year-old Thomas was said to be preparing for his final examination, which is to commence on July 5, 2021. It was not certain if he had an underlying ailment but there were speculations that he might have been stressed as a result of examination pressure. A student told SaharaReporters, "His name is Emmanuel Thomas, a 500-level student of the school. He was just coming for a test from the school hostel and suddenly rain started, so he decided to take cover in a building called Assadel. That's when and wherein he slumped and died. This is really sad. He was about to take his final examination on 5th July."
