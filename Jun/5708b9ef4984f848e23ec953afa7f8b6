The newly sworn-in Chairman of Emohua local government area of Rivers State, Dr. Chidi Julius Lloyd, on Tuesday, resumed duty under a mango tree within the council secretariat. He said the aim is to check the attitude of civil servants to their duties while expressing worry over the lack of seriousness often displayed by local government workers.  The chairman, who said he would not be ashamed to learn from experienced fellow local government chairmen, noted that he was not under the tree for too long before they understood that it was the chairman that was sitting there. “I sat under the mango tree deliberately to check egress and ingress of staff. They didn’t know that the chairman was under the mango tree. “The civil servants were just coming in the way they liked. You could see the docility in the civil servants. I wasn’t under the tree for too long before they understood that it was the chairman that was sitting there. “As a local government, there must be areas where we have a comparative advantage over the others. “So, for those areas where we are not doing well, especially for me who is an up-starter, I don’t think I will have any difficulty in meeting a fellow chairman who may have been there to ask how they did it. That is peer review; nobody should be afraid of learning. “So, I will find out from local government areas like Ikwerre and others to know how they did it. So, once we know that, we will hit the ground running.” Lloyd, who is the former leader of the Rivers State House of Assembly, was a statutory member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State and an ally of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi.
