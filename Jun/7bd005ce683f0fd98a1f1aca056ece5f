Hassan Magaji, a baker in the Galadimawa area of Kaduna State, has confessed to supplying bread to bandits. Magagi, who was recently arrested by the Intelligence Response Team of the Inspector-General of Police, said he sold bread worth N70,000 daily to the bandits during the time that some university students were abducted.  It is not clear if he was referring to students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, who spent over a month in captivity, or the College of Mechanisation students in Afaka. “I observed that whenever they kidnapped many people, like during the kidnap of those university students, the quantity of bread that they bought increased. During that period I delivered up to N70,000 worth of bread every day until recently when it dropped to N50,000 again. “I have not benefitted much except that I married a new wife and I was able to save money to take care of two wives. To stop banditry, the government should recruit more security men. We prefer police because they know the job.” Bandits have been terrorising residents of Kaduna and its environs. On Saturday, angry residents blocked the ever-busy Abuja-Kaduna highway to protest incessant attacks. Despite repeated assurances from government, armed gangs have been making life a hell for people.
