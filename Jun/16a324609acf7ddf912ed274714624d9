On Tuesday, Nigeria’s Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, announced the arrest and extradition of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The IPOB leader was subsequently re-arraigned before a Federal High Court in Abuja.  Binta Nyako, the presiding judge, ordered that the Department of State Services (DSS) remand Kanu till July 26 for the continuation of trial. He is facing charges bordering on treasonable felony instituted against him at the court in response to years of campaign for the independent Republic of Biafra through IPOB. He was granted bail in April 2017 for health reasons but skipped bail after flouting some of the conditions given to him by the court. In a broadcast via Radio Biafra in 2019, Kanu boasted that the Nigerian court lacked the power to try him, describing the court as a Kangaroo court. He averred that he wasn’t a Nigerian citizen and vowed to challenge every move by the Nigerian government to convict him becuase he has done nothing wrong. "The revocation of my bail will never ever hold; they can never convict us because we have done nothing wrong. "Every move they make, every decision they take, I will challenge. I have instructed my lawyers, we will challenge in a competent court of law here in Britain where law actually works. I am waiting for them. "Any day you instruct INTERPOL, that day I will take it up in court and they must answer because here is a civilised country. "First, I am not a Nigerian citizen. Your bail revocation will never ever work. Anybody interested in revoking my bail would have asked the army what they were doing in my place,” he said.
