Some supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Jigawa state have vowed to attack members of the opposition ahead of Saturday’s bye-election for the Gwaram Federal Constituency of state. In a video seen by SaharaReporters, the members, chanting the name of the APC candidate, Yusuf Galambi were seen with guns, cutlasses and other different weapons.  The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had fixed June 19 for the poll. This followed the death of the former holder of the office, Yuguda Hassan Kila on March 4, following which the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila declared the seat vacant. “Consequently, the commission has fixed Saturday, 19th June, 2021 for the conduct of bye-election to fill the vacant seat for the said constituency in the House of Representatives,” INEC had said in a statement. “The official notification for the election will be published on 17th May 2021.  “Political parties shall conduct their primaries between 18th and 24th May, 2021. “The access code for online submission of nomination forms will be available for collection from 24th May 2021 at the commission’s headquarters in Abuja, while the last day for submission of the list of nominated candidates is 28th May 2021 at 6pm.”
