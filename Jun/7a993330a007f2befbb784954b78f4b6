Yoruba Nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho on Monday evening stormed Igangan in the Ibarapa North Local Government Area of Oyo state. His visit, according to his spokesman Olayomi Koiki, was over weekend’s attacks by suspected herders in the village. Sunday Igboho Gunmen had on Saturday invaded the community, leaving no fewer than 10 people dead, with several property burnt, including the traditional ruler’s palace. Igboho in a video obtained by SaharaReporters got to the town on Monday in a convoy with many residents cheering. During the visit, it was learnt Igboho also tried to comb the forests with his men in search of the killer herdsmen but was prevented by operatives of the Nigerian army who allegedly trailed his convoy immediately he got to the town. The Yoruba agitator was later spotted waving to the people from a white Toyota Hilux while his supporters escorted him back into the town with their motorbikes. Igboho, in January gave Fulani herders seven days to leave Igangan area, blaming them for the killings, kidnappings and other atrocities going on there. The house of the Seriki Fulani of Igangan, Saliu Abdulkadir was burnt at the expiration of the ultimatum following which he fled the community. Many residents of the area have described the recent attack by suspected Fulani herders as a reprisal for the eviction of the Fulani leader.
