Travellers have lamented the hell they were recently made to go through in the hands of security operatives at Ukwu Orji, Mgbidi and Ihiala junction along Owerri- Onitsha Road. One of victims told SaharaReporters what he went through during his trip from Owerri to Onitsha. File photo used to illustrate story. "Aero cancelled my flight to Asaba from Abuja, so I decided to use Owerri Airport. "My experience was not a good one at all, after about 15 minutes drive, our driver was forced to park and we were all asked to come down. We walked like 3 km with our hands up like criminals. "The worse of it all was a guy held his phone up, and the soldiers there took the phone from him and smashed it on the road. There are three places where you are required to raise your hands like that. "Even in Borno state or Niger State, such dehumanising acts can't happen," he said. A lady also said they were made to trek some kilometres in rain. Security personnel were deployed to Owerri recently after unidentified assailants attacked public facilities in the city, including state police headquarters.
