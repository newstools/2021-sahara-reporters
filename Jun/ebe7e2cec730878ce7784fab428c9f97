A teacher working with Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State, says they had prior information that bandits would invade the school and community. The school on Thursday came under attack with some students and staff members abducted.  According to Daily Trust, the teacher, who did not want to be named said that before the attack, they had received information on a plan to invade Birnin Yauri community. He said to prevent an attack on the school, a detachment of mobile policemen was deployed last week. The teacher said when the bandits finally struck, the security operatives engaged them in a shootout but they were overpowered. He said after abducting the victims, the bandits used a bus belonging to the parent of a student who came to the school to pick up his son who was to take the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) on Saturday, to evacuate the victims. He said in the confusion that ensued after the attack, the school authorities were unable to conduct a headcount to ascertain the number of abducted students. “All I can tell you now is that one of the policemen guarding the school was killed. Many of our students, both male, and female, were abducted by the bandits. It is a co-education school, you know it is a Federal Government College. “Three or four teachers of the college were abducted. Out of the abductees, there is a Vice Principal and a female teacher. Two students, a male and female were said to have been shot by the bandits. The boy was shot in the buttocks while the girl sustained a gunshot injury on her arm,” he said.
