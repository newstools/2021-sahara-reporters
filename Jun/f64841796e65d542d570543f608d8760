Nigerians on social media have lampooned veteran actor, Yemi Solade, for backing the Muhammadu Buhari-led government on the recent Twitter ban. Solade had in an interview with GoldmyneTV described the move as the “best decision the Presidency could have made”.  The actor stated that the microblogging platform went too far by insulting Buhari and by extension, all Nigerians. He said, “This is not the first time Twitter will try to humiliate Nigeria. It happened to Pastor Chris Oyakhilome some years back. I think the white supremacist and imperialist tendencies should be curbed sometimes. “As much as I am of the opinion that everybody has a right to expression and thoughts, but when a platform is used to want to ferment trouble and project anarchy, there should be rules regulating such practices. In this case, a lot happens on Twitter. “I am not really a Twitter fan; I do little on Twitter. I would want to align with that school of thought that says Twitter was not really helping. Nigeria has so many problems to contend with and Twitter was not really helping the country. “I support my President this time around though. I am not trying to doublespeak, but I think it is a two-way thing. The best the Presidency could do has been done for now. We don’t know how long, but we hope the issue will be resolved and Twitter will begin to function in Nigeria.” Reacting to the statement, Nigerians on Twitter blasted the actor, describing him as a lackey and member of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
