A woman arrested by the police last October during the #EndSARS protest, Kemisola Ogunniyi, has given birth to a baby while at Surulere Prison in Ondo. Ogunniyi was arrested in Akure and has been imprisoned since October 24, 2020, while going to a pharmacy to buy drugs for her mother.  But she was arrested by the police who said she was one of the participants of the #EndSARS protest in the state. The police claimed she was one of the #EndSARS protesters who burnt the office of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state last year, about eight months ago. Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, revealed this on his Facebook page on Wednesday. Sowore, therefore, called on Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the state to look into the issue, adding that the mother of the newborn was innocent and never committed any offence.  "@RotimiAkeredolu Kemisola Ogunniyi just delivered a baby in prison. She was arrested in Akure during #Endsars, didnâ€™t commit any offence, only going to the pharmacy for her mother @policeng arrested her, claimed she looks like #EndSARS protesters who burnt @OfficialAPCNg office. "The green cloth on the table is the same she has been wearing in prison. Kemisola has been imprisoned at Surulere prison in Ondo state since October 24th, 2020!" Sowore wrote.
