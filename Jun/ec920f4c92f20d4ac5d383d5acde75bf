Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have abducted the Eleda of Eda-Ile in Ekiti East Local Government Area of Ekiti State, Oba Benjamin Omotayo. It was gathered that the monarch was kidnapped on Friday evening while working on his farm in the community.  He was said to have been seized in the presence of his wife.

The Commander of the Ekiti State Security Network called Amotekun, Brigadier General Joe Komolafe(retd.), confirmed the abduction, adding that all the security outfits in Ekiti, including police, soldiers, Amotekun corps, local hunters and Vigilance groups, are already in the forests searching for the monarch.
