Gun-wielding bandits on Friday abducted scores of travellers along Kachia Road in Kaduna State, in a broad daylight operation. SaharaReporters learnt that the victims were taken away from the vehicles they boarded and escorted at gunpoint into the forests.  Photographs seen by SaharaReporters show several empty vehicles by the roadside as other motorists who got to the scene wondered and expressed shock at the whereabouts of the victims. Kaduna has in recent months become synonymous with kidnappings, ranging from abductions of school students to villagers and motorists. The security agencies have also not been spared in the onslaughts. SaharaReporters had on Tuesday reported how gunmen suspected to be bandits invaded the military barracks of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, Kaduna State, and taken away a herd of cattle in the early hours of Thursday. The incident happened around 2:00 am as the gunmen arrived at the barracks and started shooting sporadically in the air to cause panic in the Army community. Though the exact number of the cattle stolen could not be determined, an eyewitness had told SaharaReporters on Thursday evening that the cows would not be less than a hundred in number based on previous experience. According to the source who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons, the cattle were owned by Army officers. He, therefore, expressed shock that the barracks could be so porous for bandits to attack without any form of resistance. The source told SaharaReporters the first time it happened was last year and that about 400 cows were taken away by the bandits in what he described as a bloodless attack on the barracks. He, however, said some of the animals found their way back to their ranch. The Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji in Kaduna State is a training facility for the Nigerian Armed Forces, including the army, air force, and navy.
