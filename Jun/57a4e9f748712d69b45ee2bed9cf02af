The vigilant troops spotted an occupant of the vehicle, who claimed to be a military man, Sergeant Aminu Sule. “Upon a body search, the occupant was found to be in possession of a pair of camouflage uniform, military boots, knife and substance suspected to be charms. “On further interrogation, the suspect confessed to be traveling to Ogbomoso in Oyo State. “He further claimed that the uniform and boots belonged to his brother who is a soldier,” the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, said in a release on Tuesday. Nwachukwu noted that after closely scrutinising the suspect, he was discovered to be fleeing from the ongoing operations in Niger State to a safe haven. He said, “The suspect was immediately apprehended and handed over to the police at Mokwa for further investigation. “The heat on bandits and other criminal elements in Niger State has caused them to start fleeing to supposed safe havens. Members of the public, particularly around Niger and contiguous states are therefore enjoined to be vigilant and report any suspected movement of fleeing bandits to security agencies. “Meanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Major General Faruk Yahaya, has assured law-abiding citizens of Niger State and indeed Nigeria of the safety of their lives and property. “He further enjoined them to be wary of such sinister movements by fleeing bandits and continue to support the security agencies with useful information to enable them maintain peace and security of the country."
