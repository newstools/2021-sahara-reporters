Men of the Nigeria Police Force on Saturday morning thwarted a June 12 protest in the Gudu area of the Federal Capital Territory when they stormed the area and started firing tear gas canisters. According to Punch, the protest began around 08:30 am and was going on smoothly with the protesters, mainly youths, expressing their dissatisfaction with the nation's state.  The protesters, who chanted "Buhari must go", "Say no to injustice", amongst other solidarity phrases, scampered for safety when the security operatives started shooting.
