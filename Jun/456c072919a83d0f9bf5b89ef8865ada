President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the threats by the Niger Delta Avengers to attack oil installations. The militant group had in a statement threatened to “bring down” oil installations in the South-South, after accusing the Nigerian government of marginalising the region.  NDA, which started operations in 2016, attacked oil-producing facilities that led to a huge decline in Nigeria’s oil production. They also announced the launch of ‘Operation Humble', a new mission to resume the attacks. Reacting in a statement on Sunday, Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, noted that the issues raised by the group had been responded to when the president met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa. The statement read, “The media was Sunday awash with threats and demands by a group, Niger Delta Avengers, to embark on economic sabotage through bombing of critical oil and gas installations unless certain demands, including development of the Niger Delta, and restructuring of the Federation, were met. “It is, however, curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, and the germane issues had been responded to, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).”
