Some hunters in the Okehi Local Government Area of Kogi State have arrested four bandits who turned a forest within the Okene-Lokoja road into an Indian hemp farm. The hunters, in a night raid, also destroyed the Indian hemp farm belonging to the suspected criminals.  The criminals were also said to be specialised in terrorising motorists within the area. A Facebook post by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor of Kogi State, Onogwu Mohammed, on Sunday explained that the suspected criminals train a special breed of dogs to ward off anyone coming into their territory, thus making the area inaccessible for security personnel. According to Onogwu, during the raid, four of the bandits were arrested, while ten of their guard dogs were killed. The Chief Press Secretary, while quoting the Chairman of Okehi Local Government Area, Abdulraheem Ohiare who led the operation, warned that Kogi State is a no-go area for criminal elements. He added that the state government will continue to hunt down criminal elements found within the state.
