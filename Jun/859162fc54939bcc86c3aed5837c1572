9 Months Ago He also indicted the ICPC for revealing information to the institution, which eventually led to the termination of his appointment by the college. He stated that the institution was worried that he was not yielding to the demands to alter or falsify records to divert funds meant for projects in the school. On Tuesday, at the court hearing, Ameh stated that the defendants, on being served with the substantive suit as well as the motion for interlocutory injunction, decided to undermine and pre-empt the court and had the hidden agenda to foist a fait accompli on the Honourable Court. In opposition, the institution argued that the letter of termination of Joseph Ameh's appointment was prepared before filing the case but was not issued to Ameh on the same day he managed to come to school. They also claimed they did not plot to subvert, sabotage, undermine and foist a faith accompli on the Court. The counsel for the institution, P.O. Ugbo with M.K. Umeana averred that Joseph Ameh has not discharged the very high standard of proof to be entitled to an order for mandatory injunction against the institution. See Also

9 Months Ago The duo stated that the court must be circumspect and neutral by maintaining a balance between the parties and by desisting from making any issues that will finally determine the substantive case which will still be pending before it. They urged the court to refuse the application in the interest of justice, noting that the claimant's dismissal was in line with due process. However, while delivering the ruling, the presiding judge, Justice Targema held that the institution's termination of Joseph’s appointment after service of court processes on them was not the appropriate thing to do. He ruled, “The decision by the 1st to 4th defendants to terminate the appointment of the claimant on 13th May, 2020 after the 1st to 4th defendants were served the complaint and motion on notice for an interlocutory injunction (filed on 8th May, 2020) on 11th May, 2020 effectively snuffed life out of the claimant’s originating processes; the rest in this suit.”
