Six people were reportedly killed in Inalende, Abebi, and Opoo area of Ibadan, the Oyo state capital in an overnight gang war between factional members of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC). SaharaReporters reported on Thursday that two people were killed in the war but the groups were hanging around to retaliate against the attack.  Resident on Friday morning confirmed that the groups stormed Abebi and killed six youths in the reprisal in the area. A resident who spoke on condition of anonymity told SaharaReporters that his landlord's son was a victim of the overnight killing but he could not mention his name as his father had not been briefed on the incident. He said: "My landlord lost his son in the OPC clash last night. We have yet to brief the man. Our Imam will brief him after the Jumat prayer today. So wait for the full gist and names of the victims after Jumat. I don't want the man to hear about the death of his son in the media. "Those who said there were four casualties are not truthful. The whole thing happened in my area. As we speak, they have counted six dead people. Though the police are everywhere, they could not stop the killings. I think they are still suffering from the post-EndSARS syndrome. No vehicle is allowed to ply Mokola Roundabout-Orita-Merin-Beere road as we speak," he said. Our correspondent reports that Ibadan, the Oyo state capital, has been experiencing killings, robberies, and maiming of innocent residents recently.
