 Nigeria’s Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, has ordered the prosecution of those violating the ban on Twitter. The directive is in a statement issued by Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, media aide of Malami, on Saturday.  The statement read, “Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN has directed for the immediate prosecution of offenders of the Federal Government ban on Twitter operations in Nigeria. “Malami directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation (DPPF) at the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to swing into action and commence in earnest the process of prosecution of violators of the Federal Government De-activation of operations of Twitter in Nigeria. “Malami directed the DPPF to liaise with the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, National Communication Communication (NCC) and other relevant government agencies to ensure the speedy prosecution of offenders without any further delay.” Nigeria’s information and culture minister Lai Mohammed had on Friday announced Twitter’s suspension in a statement by his media aide, Segun Adeyemi. The suspension by the Nigerian government comes days after a post by President Muhammadu Buhari on the 1967 civil war was deleted by the microblogging platform. The Nigerian government’s spokesman cited “the persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence” as the reason for the suspension. A check by SaharaReporters in the early hours of Saturday showed that the platform is no more active within the country.
