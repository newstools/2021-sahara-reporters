Students of the Cross River State University of Science and Technology, Calabar, went on the rampage on Friday after gunmen attacked a final year student of the school, who was trying to rescue a robbed lady.  SaharaReporters learnt that the deceased student, Jacob Ushie, was shot dead by the robbers while trying to recover the valuables stolen by the attackers.  Eyewitnesses told SaharaReporters that the killing sparked protests in the university in Calabar, with students decrying the spate of insecurity in their environs. SaharaReporters learnt that the students got angrier when the institution's authorities, instead of addressing the rampaging students, rather deployed soldiers on the campus to clamp down on the protesters. "A student was killed last night, and it caused this massive protest. A final year was killed on our campus while trying to rescue another female student who the assailants had just robbed. Instead of talking to us, the Vice-Chancellor mobilised military men, and they invaded our school. "They are harassing the students. They beat up several people. Don't we have a right to protest?" a student, who preferred to be anonymous, said. "The attackers collected a girl's phone, and when the deceased student noticed it, he immediately ran after those cultists thinking she would get back the phone. And that was how the unexpected happened. They killed the final-year student," another source stated. SaharaReporters learnt that the soldiers are still parading the campus, while the deceased's family had yet to be contacted formally by the school authorities.
