Two women, one of them a reverend sister, have been kidnapped in two different incidents on Sunday morning in Imo State. In the first incident at Ohii in Owerri West local government area, worshippers at St Philip's Anglican Church, Ohii Parish, were stunned when some men stormed the church at about 7:45 am and kidnapped one Mrs lkenna Onwusoroaka.  The kidnappers were said to have driven out with her in their vehicle, leaving the woman's car behind. Youth of Orogwe Archdeaconry held their camp/conference at the church premises and had to run for their lives. In the second incident, a reverend sister was abducted at Dim anÂ Nume, Isu in Nwangele local government area of the state a few minutes after the Ohii incident. DailyTrust reports that the reverend sister was driving in her car when the kidnappers crossed her and forced her to stop. A witness said the kidnappers forced her into their car while one entered and drove her car behind. The two incidents came at a time; relatives of Mr. Chimezie Okpara, who was kidnapped on Friday at his Umudurunna home, are still in a quandary over his continued abduction. Okpara was kidnapped while returning to his house from the market where he had gone to buy things for the burial ceremony of his brother's father-in-law. Sources in the family told our correspondent that more than 48 hours after the incident, the kidnappers are yet to contact the family. The Police Public Relations Officer, SP Bala Elkana, could not be reached as his phone was switched off.
