3 Months Ago The state police command subsequently arrested and detained some of the OPC members involved in the arrest, accusing them of murder.  The command said a woman was burnt to death while the OPC members were attempting to arrest Wakili.  The three detainees on Tuesday who appeared before the magistrate's court, presided over by A.O. Amzat, were ordered to be released three months after their detention.  They were discharged and acquitted after the state’s Directorate of Public Prosecutions failed to prove to the court that the OPC men were guilty as charged.
