The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has allegedly invaded a female hostel at Alaro Street, in the Sango area of Ibadan, Oyo state early Friday morning. A video obtained by SaharaReporters shows a female hostel with apprehensive students speaking Pidgin English and shouting for help.  They accused the EFCC of harassment.  "See what EFCC did to us, please we need help. We cannot sleep since after 2am and this 3am. We are all females here. "They broke our doors, tore our nets and everything. We tried to even defend ourselves because we thought they were thieves. "Please, we need justice, we are students. They were even told that we are students. None of us put on clothes. We are in Alaro, close to Ibadan Polytechnic gate, Ibadan. We need justice in Nigeria, we need justice." When contacted, the spokesperson for the EFCC, Wilson Uwajaren, said he had not seen the video and therefore would not like to comment on it yet.
