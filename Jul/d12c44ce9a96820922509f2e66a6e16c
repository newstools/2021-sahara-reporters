Two villagers were also killed. “There corpses have been taken to a mortuary in Yariman Bakura Special Hospital, Gusau,” the source told SaharaReporters. Deadly attacks have raged across Zamfara state where bandits have thrived. Farming and herding communities in the state have long been terrorised by gangs who raid villages, stealing cattle and kidnap residents for ransom. In 2019, the state government entered a peace agreement with the gunmen.About 15 brand new Hilux vehicles and cash gifts were also given to leaders of different 'repentant' gangs of bandits by the governor in 2020. But despite all these, communities in the state are still being attacked and residents kidnapped and/or killed.
