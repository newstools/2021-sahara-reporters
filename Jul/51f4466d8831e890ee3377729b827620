A 30-year-old man identified as Shamsudeen Ibrahim has sued a woman known as Hannatu Aliyu before a Shari’a court sitting in Rigasa, Kaduna State for allegedly calling him gay. Alhassan Aliyu, the lawyer for the complainant, alleged that Hannatu, who is a thrift collector, met with his client on the road and asked him about one Murjanatu’s N1,000 daily contributions, Punch reports.  The lawyer said his client, Ibrahim, had noted that there was a case of mistaken identity but Hannatu resorted to calling his client different names. He said, “My client categorically told her he was not Murjanatu’s messenger. The defendant rained insults on my client. She called him a pimp who acts like a gay. ”That is why we are here to complain against defamation of character praying the court to look into the matter and grant us justice.” In her defence, Aliyu, denied the allegation, saying they were false. The judge, Malam Salisu Abubakar-Tureta, granted Aliyu bail on the condition that she provides a reliable surety with a N20,000 bail bond. Abubakar-Tureta adjourned the matter until 2, August for the complainant to present his witnesses.
