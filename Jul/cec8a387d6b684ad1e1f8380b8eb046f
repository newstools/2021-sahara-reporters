Ms Ogbonnaya ordered the prison officers to supply a register for Umuibe to sign in daily for the 90 days and after which he would be free to go home, Peoples Gazette reports. She went further to warn him to desist from committing crimes and be of good behaviour. Earlier, the defence counsel, Ruth Mamza, asked the court to temper justice with mercy, stressing that the defendant was a first time offender with no criminal record. Ms Mamza stated that the defendant was remorseful and understood the gravity of his offence. “The defendant has repented and refunded everything he collected from the crime,’’ Ms Mamza said. The prosecuting counsel, Ijeabalum Diribe told the court that Umuibe and his defence counsel had agreed and signed a plea bargain on June 16. Mr Diribe urged the court to sentence and convict Mr Umuibe in line with the terms of the plea bargain entered which positions that upon conviction, the defendant should pay N113, 000 fine or one month in prison. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission charged Mr Umuibe with cheating and falsely representing himself as a Chinese citizen and military man named Maisbay Chang. The prosecuting counsel said Mr Umuibe fraudulently induced a Chinese lady on WE chat and collected N113,000 from her. She said the offence breached the provisions of Section 95 of the Penal Code.
