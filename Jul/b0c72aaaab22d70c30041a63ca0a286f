Suspected bandits have killed nine persons in an attack on the Makarau Jankasa community in Zango Kataf local government area of Kaduna State. According to a report by Leadership, natives have fled their homes to neighbouring communities as a result of the attack.  The attack comes barely 72 hours after a similar attack on the Warkan community in the same local government area where nine people were also killed and many sustained injuries while the bandits burnt down 12 houses. A resident, Donald Bityong, who confirmed the incident, said the attackers invaded the Makarau Jankasa community on Sunday, around 5 pm. He said security operatives arrived in the village at a time when the criminals had already perpetrated their act and disappeared into the bush. Bityong called on the federal and state governments including security agencies to do more to secure lives and properties. “These attacks are too much for us to bear, no one is longer safe in our community. Nobody can go to his farm now,” he said.
