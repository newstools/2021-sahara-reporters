The Senior Pastor of the House on The Rock Church, Pastor Paul Adefarasin, has said the Independent National Electoral Commission is behind Nigeria’s woes for publishing false figures. The cleric described the nation’s electoral umpire as a fraud, adding that results generated in both population census and polls in this country were lies.  Adefarasin revealed this during a sermon in his church as seen in a video obtained by SaharaReporters. He said, “You have got to go into politics and government deliberately. By the way, if we don’t fix Nigeria's problem, by that I mean Independent National Electoral Commission; I am saying it plainly. “Put me in trouble if you like, INEC is a fraud. Numbers in Nigeria as far as census is concerned, as far as election is concerned are a lie. And if nobody will speak about it, the righteous will speak about it. Our righteousness is not of ourselves but it is of him and he will protect. “Where the numbers are not properly reflected in our voting; this is the only country in West Africa, when you move to the ocean through the desert and the numbers decrease or rather the only country in the world that you move a large number of water or little or no water and the numbers increase; it was not Nigerians that started it.”
