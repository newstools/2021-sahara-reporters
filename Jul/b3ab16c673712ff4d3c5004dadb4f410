The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has elected Comrade Iyanu Looto, popularly known as Marley as its National Financial Secretary. Iyanu, a 23-year-old student of the Ondo State University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa was elected at a special extraordinary Senate meeting of the association in Akure, Ondo state.  Speaking to newsmen, the new NANS leader said the movement to give the association back to young comrades had been actualised. “My election is mainly for the betterment of Nigerian students. All funds received on behalf of the association will be properly recorded and deposited to NANS’ treasury. The era of people turning their personal accounts to NANS own is over. “I also want people to know that NANS is not only for tertiary institutions, it’s time to break NANS down to the lowest level nursery, primary and secondary schools. It’s so sad that these students don’t have advocates.“ Meanwhile, the outgoing President of the association, Comrade Danielson Bamidele Akpan in a statement obtained by SaharaReporters congratulated Iyanu and Comrade Abdulmajeed Oyeniyi who was elected as National President. Akpan again debunked speculations that he handed over to a new leadership led by Sunday Asefon. The latest election comes a few months after a faction in the association announced Asefon as its President amid chaos and violence that characterised its convention at the old parade ground, Abuja. About 20 members of the association, who gathered at the old parade ground in Abuja for the convention held in December 2020, sustained wounds from gunshots and machetes after thugs loyal to a factional coordinator of the association in Zone D (Southwest) began attacking delegates. A few weeks ago, Asefon, a factional President was accused of collecting N70 million from the Nigerian government and Kogi state governor, Yahaya Bello to attack human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, and others.
