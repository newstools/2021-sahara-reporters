Yohana Isheme and his wife, Noami Yohana, have been abducted at Ukya Sabo community in Toto local government area of Nasarawa state. A resident of Ukya Sabo, simply identified as Samuel, said the incident happened around 1 am on Saturday.  He said the kidnappers in large numbers invaded the community with sophisticated weapons. He said the kidnappers positioned themselves at strategic places within the community before other gangs scaled the fence of the victims’ house. “They forced the back door open after they scaled the fence and went straight into the man’s bedroom to whisk him away alongside his wife at gunpoint,” he said. He said the kidnappers shot sporadically in the air to scare neighbours as they were leading their victims out of the community into the bush. Daily Trust learnt that the husband, Isheme, is a staff member with the health department in the Toto local government area, while his wife is a class teacher at Local Education Authority (LEA) primary school, Tika in the area. The head of the information unit of Toto local government area, Mr Gabriel Hagai, confirmed the kidnap incident to the newspaper. The spokesman for the Nasarawa state police command, DSP Ramhan Nansel, said he had yet to receive the report of the incident, saying he would contact the DPO in charge of Toto local government division and get back to our reporter later.
