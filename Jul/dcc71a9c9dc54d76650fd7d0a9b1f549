I think it's very clear now that the only agenda this government has at hand is to tackle IPOB and leave other important agendas unattended. Hmm, sounds too malicious ooooo! We don tire for this administration jooor.” Another user Precious Sunday wrote, “Nigerian Security Agencies will escort Gumi to the forest to meet the bandits for discussion, wait till they finish and escort him back home, then return to combing the forest to search for same bandits. Worse still, it makes sense to them.” Ene Possible said, “Nigeria government should be careful you don't arrest anything you see on the way because of retaliation, less you end up putting the nation in big trouble we couldn't come out from, don't forget Nigeria is no match for Israel.” Alex Onyebuchi said, “Just for having contact with IPOB? But Gumi has had several contacts with Bandits and Herdsmen and kidnappers. Why these selective arrests? What are you afraid of? Won't people interact again? Aren't you all having contacts?”  Now our message will surely get the whole world ð. This is what Nigeria Government are good at,.
