The Chief Security Officer of A4 Gas Plant at Ugbokodo in the Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State, popularly known as CSO has reportedly died after drinking one big bottle of dry gin.  It was learnt that he consumed such an amount of liquor to prove to his friends that he was an adept drinker, according to Warri Aproko Special.  A source said the CSO always misbehaved whenever he took alcohol, even if it was little quantity.  Some of his friends were said to be fond of making fun of him because of this, so his decision to take a bottle of gin at a go was believed to have been done to prove them wrong.  "CSO always misbehaved whenever he took a small quantity of alcohol, which always drew attention to him by the people that laughed at him. They advised him to stop drinking because he didn't know how to drink.  "He wanted to prove them wrong by showing them that he could drink, and let them know that he was a 'professional' in drinking.  "He went to buy a big bottle of Gordon dry gin and brought it to where the people spoke thinks about him in jest, he opened it and put the big bottle in his mouth and emptied it once," someone who knew him said.  The CSO collapsed a few minutes after he finished the drink, and was taken to the hospital where he later died.
