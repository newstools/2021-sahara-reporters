There were 5 young guys inside the 4matic car as policemen were seen pursuing them with their Sienna car. "The guys were driving very fast along DLA Road, Asaba as the police were seen pursuing and shooting at them, just close to Falcon Club junction. Unfortunately, the guy driving hit a fence and the car stopped moving. "The policemen then stopped their own Sienna car, opened fire on them, shot one of them and he died instantly.
