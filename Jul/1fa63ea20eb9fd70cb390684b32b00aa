Several Yoruba groups agitating for the self-determination of south-west states have gathered at the Soka residence of Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho for a protest. This follows the raid last Thursday by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) on Igboho's residence at Soka, Ibadan, Oyo State.  The DSS had confirmed a joint team of security operatives raided Igboho’s residence last week based on an intelligence report. In a live video by BBC Pidgin, the agitators were seen gathered in front of Igboho's house getting ready for the protest. Also, Igboho’s spokesperson Olayomi Koiki, in a live video on Wednesday, stated the Pro-Yoruba Nation protesters will gather at Soka, Ibadan for the protest. He said: “By Wednesday morning in Ibadan from Soka, Yoruba Nation agitators are to assemble at Ibadan for a protest as regards the recent development that has to do with Chief Sunday Igboho and other agitators“The protest will head out from Soka. There will be a protest. Rally is what we have been doing, this time around we are doing a protest.”
