Â Jalingo is still facing four counts of treasonable felony, terrorism, cultism and attempt to overthrow the Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River and President Buhari. Jalingo had been arrested on the orders of the governor on August 22, 2019, after he raised questions on the whereabouts of N500 million meant for the establishment of Cross River Microfinance Bank. He was detained arbitrarily for over four months with his fundamental human rights grossly violated during the period. It was only on February 17, 2020, that Jalingo was released from detention after perfecting his bail condition. Before his arrest, the police had invited him after receiving a petition by the bank stemming from his report. Jalingo had informed the police he was out of the state and the invitation was moved to August 26, 2019. However, he was arrested by the police outside Cross River State four days before the scheduled date. He was arrested in Lagos, blindfolded, tortured and taken to Cross River State by road where he was handcuffed to a refrigerator.
