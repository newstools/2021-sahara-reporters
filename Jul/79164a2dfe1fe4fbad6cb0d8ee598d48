Olai Godwin, a lecturer in the Department of Management, Ignatius Ajuru University of Education, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has been placed on a three-month suspension by the management of the institution for demanding money from final year students in order to help them write their project works. The suspension took place following the audio recordings that surfaced in which some of his students alleged that he demanded N70,000 for the projects.  The students were reportedly final year students of his department assigned to him for the supervision of their projects. The Vice Chancellor of the institution, Professor Ozo-mekuri Ndimele, stated that Godwin had promised in the audio, to help complete the entire projects, type it and bind them, without any contributions from the students. He disclosed this on his Facebook page on Tuesday adding that the lecturer’s case has been transferred to the Staff Disciplinary Committee of the institution for further investigation. “The Management of Ignatius Ajuru University of Education has placed Mr. Godwin Olai, a lecturer with the Department of Management, on three months’ suspension and his matter referred to the Staff Disciplinary Committee for further investigation. We are determined to keep our surroundings clean. Let’s all be careful,” the VC said
