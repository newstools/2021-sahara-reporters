There is palpable tension and threat of a breakdown of law and order in Akobi Crescent, off Fashoro street of Surulere, Lagos state, as residents have accused a ‘notorious’ land-grabber, one Adams Akinfolabi Akindele of using thugs and policemen to chase them out of their homes. They also accused the police officers, whose services were employed by Akindele, of shooting indiscriminately at residents and destroying valuables in the process.  Speaking to SaharaReporters, a source said no fewer than 150 thugs and 30 policemen stormed the street, claiming all the houses in the area belonged to the suspected land-grabber. She said residents have been living in fear ever since the land-grabbers invaded the area on Friday. The source further accused Akindele of using the name of the late Iyalode Efunroye Tinubu to perpetrate his illegal activities.“Some thugs came here with police officers and said they have taken possession of Akanbi crescent. They drove all of us away; see all the homes, they have taken possession. A lot of thugs came in here today. “People should come and help us, we don’t know when this started. We have had properties here for more than 100 years and some people just came from nowhere and said that our land and prosperities belong to them. They gave us five days.  “Government should come and help us, we are calling on Lagos state government to do something about it. People in the community are panicking and residents have been living in fear since. “The land-grabber's name is Adams Akinfolabi Akindele and his company's name is Adamakin Investment and Works Limited. He is using the name of Iyalode Efunroye Tinubu to take over different landed properties. “Imagine, about 150 thugs and 30 police officers came to this small street and said they are taking procession of all the houses, giving us just days to quit.”
