The United States Embassy in Abuja has said it would reduce public operations effective today, Friday, July 16, 2021. A statement posted on Facebook Thursday night said the development was needed as “a security precaution.”  It noted that July 20 and July 21 are holidays in Nigeria and the Embassy is scheduled to be closed on those days. The Embassy said full public operations will resume on Monday, July 26. Services to be affected include routine American citizen services, visas, and the Education Advising Center. The statement advised Americans who may experience an emergency to contact the duty officer through the Embassy switchboard. Next Tuesday and Wednesday are holidays to mark the 2021 Eid-el-Kabir celebration as security is being heightened in the nation’s capital and many states to have a hitch free celebration.
