The Kwara State Police Command has arrested a suspect for allegedly selling the body parts of his father, Michael Olagunju, to some ritualists in Kajola, Odo-Owa in the Oke-Ero Local Government Area of the state. Olagunju was allegedly murdered on his farm at Kajola last Thursday by his son, who conspired with some ritualists to remove Olagunju's body parts, including his two hands and his heart.  A brother of the deceased, who spoke to Punch on condition of anonymity, said the family members were convinced that the suspect had a hand in his father's death. "That is why we handed him over to the police," he added. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Ajayi Okasanmi, confirmed the incident. He said, "A farmer was killed on his farm at Kajola in Odo-Owa last week. One suspect has been arrested in connection with the crime. The Commissioner of Police, CP Mohammed Bagega, has ordered a discreet investigation into the matter."
