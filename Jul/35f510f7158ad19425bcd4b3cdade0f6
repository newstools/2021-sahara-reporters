The Kaduna State Government has confirmed the fresh killings in four Local Government Areas, which has claimed at least ten lives, while five youths are reportedly missing after the attacks. The state government, which is seemingly helpless in the face of the continuous attacks, said in its characteristic manner that it condemned the killings and disappearance of some persons in Zangon Kataf, Igabi, Chikun, and Jema’a Local Government Areas.  The Commissioner for Internal Security, Samuel Aruwan, stated this in a statement on Friday. He said security agencies reported killings in Kibori, Katsit, and Afana in Zangon Kataf Local Government Areas and Amana Kasuwa of Igabi LGA. He confirmed that nine persons were also killed in the Warkan village of Zangon Kataf LGA and one person in the Kakkau area of Chikun LGA. “Governor Nasir El-Rufai condoled with the families that lost loved ones and wished those injured a speedy recovery. El-Rufai directed the State Emergency Management Agency to assess damages at Warkan village and provide relief materials to the residents. “The security agencies also reported the disappearance of five youths in Kafanchan town of Jema’a LGA on Friday,” Aruwan added. The governor appealed to the affected families to remain calm as security agencies were investigating the incidents.
