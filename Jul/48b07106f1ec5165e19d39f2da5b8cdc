A source said the politician was picked up by masked men in an operation along Okigwe roundabout, Owerri on Saturday.

"This man is called Matador, Enyi-Oha na Osru. He is from Orsu Iheti Ikea in Imo State. "A diehard lover of the Fulani slave masters because of money. He was a PA to one state House of Assembly member and also a special assistant to one House of Representatives member, but presently working for government. “He was very instrumental in leading the Nigerian terrorists’ army to be bombing Orsu. Afterwards government released money for him to share in Orsu to say that nobody was killed in the bombings, knowing quite well that a lot of people lost their lives in the military air bombardments. "In his next generation, he will not be a saboteur to his people. This is a warning to all those sabotaging the Biafran land,” a voice was heard saying.Reacting to the viral video, the state police command said it had commenced investigation into the incident.
