Secessionist groups, the Biafra Think Tank, and The Biafra Watchdogs, have threatened to attack the Nigerian National Assembly complex, the Presidential Villa, the Nigeria Police Force Headquarters, among others, over the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The groups also threatened to kidnap all the ambassadors of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government, including the former Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Yusuf Burutai (retd.) and keep them hostage until Kanu is released.  The groups in a statement made available to Daily Post on Thursday stated these. The statement partly reads, “Every landlord in Biafra land must send the names, phone numbers, pictures if possible, address of any police officers, army, DSS (Department of State Services), EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission) and the military men living in their houses. “We shall inform the public and the country and airlines that gave out our leader, Kanu’s details and ensure that the staff, plane, and the country pays dearly or we will give their own countryJihadists or ISIS useful information to attack their government complex. “Today we have agreed and decided to kidnap all the ambassadors of Buhari government, including Buratai and keep them hostage till they release Nnamdi Kanu and until Buhari signs and declares Biafra. “We hereby summon all the Biafran sons and daughters working in the diaspora to attend an important meeting in the United States of America. “If Buhari refuses to release Nnamdi Kanu within 21 days from now, we shall attack the National Assembly, Aso Rock, Police Headquarters, Nigeria Army Headquarters, etc.” Kanu, who was arrested, in Kenya at the weekend, was taken to court on Tuesday and is currently being detained at the Department of State Services, DSS.
