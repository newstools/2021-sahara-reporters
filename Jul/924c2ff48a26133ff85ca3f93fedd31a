Igboho: Security Agents Must Inform Governors Before Undertaking Any Operations In States - Southern Governors Governors of states in the southern region have resolved that security agencies must duly notify them as the chief security officer of their states before carrying out any operations within their domain.  This was contained in a communiqué issued on Monday at the end of the governors’ meeting in Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos State. The forum, however, kept mum on the recent arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, and the attack on Yoruba freedom fighter, Chief Sunday Adeyemo also known as Sunday Igboho’s house but the decision of the governors came as a veiled reference to the incidents. The governors in the communiqué, “Re-emphasised the need for State Police; “Resolved that if for any reason security institutions need to undertake an operation in any State, the Chief Security Officer of the State must be duly informed; “Frowns on selective criminal administration of Justice and resolved that arrests should be made within the ambit of the Law and fundamental human rights.” Igboho's house in Ibadan was raised by the Department of State Services (DSS) last week, killing at least two of his associates and arresting 13. The agency has also declared Igboho wanted, saying he was planning to carry out attacks against the Nigerian State.
