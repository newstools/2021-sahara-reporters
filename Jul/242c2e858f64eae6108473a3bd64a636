Hundreds of protesters in Ghana have demanded that the government should provide better security to the people amid several high-profile killings. The protesters, led by opposition parties’ supporters, marched through the streets of Ghana’s capital Accra, demonstrating against what they described as rising insecurity and lawlessness since President Nana Akufo-Addo came to power in 2017.  Wearing mostly red or black, the youth wing of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) danced through the streets on Tuesday with signs such as “You tweeted for George Floyd … Ghanaians have died, speak up!” Accompanied by the honking of motorcycle horns and music blasting from pick-up trucks, the group delivered a petition to the offices of the president and speaker of Parliament, Aljazeera reports.  “Thank you to the Youth of Ghana for turning up and having a peaceful protest,” George Opare Addo, the National Youth Organiser for the NDC, posted on Twitter. “May the powers that be see reason in our protest and act accordingly.”
