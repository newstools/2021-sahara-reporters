Following the recent uprising in cult clashes in Delta State, the Commissioner of Police, Ari Mohammed Ali, has summoned top officers of the command for an emergency meeting to brainstorm on ways to wage war against cultists in the state. SaharaReporters learnt that the meeting started at about 7:30pm on Tuesday in the office of the commissioner, and lasted several hours where decisions were reached to arrest the trouble makers.  SaharaReporters gathered that between Monday and Tuesday, over four persons were killed in Asaba and its environs and a middle-aged man beheaded, a situation which created serious panic among residents. The two days cult clash also claimed the lives of a former chairman of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Oshimili South chapter, simply identified as Sanchino and an Asaba-based Surveyor simply identified as Ifeanyi. Speaking with SaharaReporters, the state police boss, Ari Mohammed Ali, disclosed that in the next few days to come, there shall be “a harvest of cultists and criminals across the state.” “As I speak with you now, there is a serious manhunt for cultists and criminals. Yes, there have been cases of cultism on the rise in recent weeks because intelligence revealed both Black Axe confraternity (Aiye) and Vikings (Buccaneers) are at loggerheads for reasons unknown." On the recent attacks on police stations in some parts of the state, Ali said, initially the command thought the attacks were carried out by members of the Indigenous People Of Biafra and the Eastern Security Network, but investigations however revealed that the attacks were carried out by cultists.
