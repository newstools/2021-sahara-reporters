A young man in Dabna Village in the Hong Local Government Area of Adamawa State, who lost his cousin and uncle to Boko Haram attack, has lamented his inability to harvest crops on his farm in the deserted village. The farmer who spoke with SaharaReporters said the attack had since demoralised him and other villagers who fled the community with little to no property just to escape being slaughtered by the terrorists.

However, he is currently restricted to the local government headquarters in Hong, a place considered safer than the rest. He said, “Since the attack, I have remained in Hong because Dabna is no longer safe. The place is deserted, everyone fled after that attack. My farm is there in Dabna, this is something I have laboured for, I hoped to get about 10 to 15 bags of maize and groundnut when I harvest the crops but my life is more important so I am in Hong for now. “Presently, I am helping a friend who is a chemist and he supports me for some basic financial needs.”On July 7, terrorists stormed Dabna village in Adamawa state, leaving 18 dead. Another survivor of the attack told SaharaReporters, “They (Boko Haram) came in large numbers, shooting sporadically. "Those of us who were lucky escaped through the bushes. About now, many of our fellow villagers have been trapped and I fear they may have been killed." Another source said about 18 human corpses were found in Kwapre, near Garaha, the village where the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, hails from.
