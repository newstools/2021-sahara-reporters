The umbrella body of Yoruba Self-Determination Groups, Ilana Omo Oodua, has alleged that operatives of the Department of State Services, during the raid on the Ibadan residence of Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho), shot at one of Igboho's associate, Adogan 48 times before butchering him to death. In a statement shared with SaharaReporters by Olayomi Koiki, Igboho's media aide, the Ilana Omo Oodua group led by historian, Banji Akintoye, claimed that the DSS operatives shot Saheed Adisa, popularly called Adogan, 48 times and when the bullets failed, a mortar was used to kill the young man. Sunday Igboho It read, "This is the face of a true warrior. His name is Adogan. He took 48 bullets to his body and was still standing like a fearless Ikoyi Eso. When shots failed the DSS, they had to slam a mortal on his head, butchering him to death. "While DSS operatives were butchering Adogan, Majasola Igboho Oosa (May peace and blessings of Eedua always be with him) had made his exit to fight another day. "It was said that the DSS so brutally decapitated Adogan's body that they were ashamed to leave his body behind. They whisked his body away, but his blood trailed them from Chief Igboho's living room to the DSS headquarters in Abuja. Trust me; we will take our revenge. RIP my good brother! No going back on the Yoruba nation. Lagos rally goes on, as planned, tomorrow. Ifa Dare." It was gathered that Adogan was killed alongside Igboho's maternal uncle, known as Alfa. Koiki also said, "One of them was shot by the DSS while a bullet did not kill the other person, they tried shooting at him, but he was not affected, so they butchered him. They killed him in cold blood." Recall that the DSS confirmed the attack on Igboho's house, stating that they killed two allies of the Yoruba rights activist during the invasion of his residence in Ibadan, Oyo state.
