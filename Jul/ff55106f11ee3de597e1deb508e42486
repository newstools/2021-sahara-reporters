The Emir said, “We are excited with your visit to the palace. We appreciate your visit to the palace from time to time even during the time of the late Emir. “We want to commend the President for the infrastructural development across the country particularly those sited in Kano just as the governor listed some of such projects despite the shortfalls in the globally economy. “We are hoping the presidential aides would continue to advise the president on the condition and wellbeing of the poor masses, especially in those aspects where he would need to be informed on certain development for necessary action.
