He urged the Nigerian government to ensure that the Presidential jet is put in good shape in order to avoid a crisis. Primate Ayodele said: “There will be threats in the Villa, I’m seeing confusion in the Villa, Buhari will lose one of his aides. “There is going to be a clash between Buhari and Osinbajo and their aides, mark my word. “Beside this, the people of Southwest will pitch against Osinbajo because people (Bola) Tinubu groomed will cause problem for him. “The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission will expose a lot of things. Buhari’s ministers will be indicted and it will cause rancour among other ministers which will lead to the resignation of a minister in Buhari’s cabinet. “Another prominent pastor will die. Buhari should be careful in his outings during the 10th and 11th and 12th month this year so they don’t attack his convoy. “The presidential plane should be put in proper shape to avoid technical problems.”
