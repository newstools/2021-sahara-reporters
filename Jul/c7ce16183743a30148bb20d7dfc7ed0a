He said, “I am originally an ANTP member, worst case I’ll renew my membership there. I have never obtained or signed any form with TAMPAN or joined any guild.

Any reaction necessary will be on the basis of human rights violation if I so seek judicial redress. You can’t lose what you don’t have.” Characters and events in Fabiyi's controversial movie, ‘Oko Iyabo’, depicted a real-life scenario involving another Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju Omiyinka, popularly known as Baba Ijesha, who was accused of sexually assaulting a minor.
