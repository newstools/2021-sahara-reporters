Chief Magistrate Tanko Muhammed of the Lugard Court in Lokoja, has adjourned the trial of two anti-President Muhammadu Buhari protesters till August 3. The court, on Thursday, resumed trial of Larry Emmanuel and Anene Victor Udoka after being granted bail following 78-days detention.  SaharaReporters gathered that the trial could not continue as a result of the failure of the police prosecutor to provide necessary files for court processes. This is despite police claims that investigations into the matter have been concluded after being afforded two months to initiate prosecution. However, the prosecution's action was met with cautionary reactions by the magistrate who threatened to strike out the case for lack of diligence prosecution if, upon the next date all processes are not put in place. In April, violent youths had descended on the two middle-aged protesters who were pasting Buhari-Must-Go posters in Lokoja, the Kogi to State capital. SaharaReporters learnt that the irate mob flogged the two youths, filmed them, and brutalised them before they were later handed over to the police. It was gathered that the police thereafter quizzed the two protesters and detained them when they insisted on seeing their lawyer before making a statement. In some viral videos, the protesters were seen being molested and questioned by the mob before they were flogged as the youths forced them to clean their painting of “Buhari Must Go.”
