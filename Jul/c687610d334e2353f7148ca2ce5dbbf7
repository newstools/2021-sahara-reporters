12 Months Ago However, the circumstances surrounding Arotile's demise remain challenging to comprehend, amid allegations that powerful forces conspired to eliminate her. The deceased was renowned for her gallantry and skills, including flying fighter choppers to areas dominated by bandits and terrorists for aerial strikes. Tolulope Arotile A cross-section of Nigerians believes her contributions to counter-insurgency operations cost her life and continue to demand a probe. But the answers they seek may not be provided soon with the seeming bungling of the prosecution of the person(s) arrested over Arotile's death. The NAF, according to former Director of Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, stated that its late officer was killed by a "reversing car." "She was inadvertently hit by the reversing vehicle of an excited former Air Force Secondary School classmate while trying to greet her," Daramola said. Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, had earlier rubbished NAF's account of how Arotile died. "The idea that she was killed after being knocked down on the Airforce Base by her friend's car is nonsensical. I suspect that Tolu was murdered, the truth is being covered up," he noted. Gani Adams, Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, and socio-cultural organization, Afenifere called NAF's "reversing car" explanation unfathomable. A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, posed ten questions on the national tragedy to NAF. Daramola declared that the military arm would not join issues with individuals or groups regarding the "spurious" claims of foul play in response to public outrage. "Arotile was a pride of the NAF. It is ludicrous for anyone to even remotely insinuate malevolent intent on the part of the service against one of its most prized assets." The Magistrate Court in Kaduna discharged two of the accused â€“ Folorunsho Igbekele and Gbayegun Deji in August last year. See Also
