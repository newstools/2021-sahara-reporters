Daily Trust SaharaReporters learnt that it has been a rowdy session since Thursday morning even before the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, made his way into the chamber for the commencement of plenary session. The South-South members, armed with copies of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, waited for the procession of the Speaker into the chamber to begin the business of the day. The lawmakers from the Niger Delta region, noticeably, Hon. Chinyere Igwe and Hon. Boma Goodhead from Rivers State and the Hon. Bede Eke from Imo State thereafter started shouting “5 percent”, gesticulating with their hands to draw attention. As the rowdy session was one, the Speaker and other principal officers matched into the chamber. In a bid to calm the fray nerves of the lawmakers, Gbajabiamila therefore called for an executive session of the House.
