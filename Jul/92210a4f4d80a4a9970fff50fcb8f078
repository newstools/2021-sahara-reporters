Suspected members of Boko Haram have attacked Katarko community in Gujba Local Government Area of Yobe state with heavy gunshots causing residents to flee to safety, SaharaReporters has gathered. The insurgents also injured a middle-aged woman and her sister.  SaharaReporters gathered that the gunmen invaded the village in the early hours of Thursday, but were reportedly repelled by the troops of Sector 2 Operation Hadin Kai mobilised to the community. Katarko which is 18 kilometres south of Damaturu, the state capital, has been under attack over 15 times. The community was last attacked on March 16, 2021, in which a primary school and a healthcare centre were burnt down by the insurgents. Boko Haram and its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province, have killed thousands and displaced millions in Northeastern Nigeria. The Nigerian military has repeatedly claimed that the insurgency had been largely defeated and frequently underplays any losses. In the past months, soldiers have been targeted by the insurgents, who wait in ambush for them. Hundreds of soldiers and officers have been reportedly killed since January 2021. At least 33 soldiers were recently killed when two explosive-laden vehicles rammed into a military convoy in Wulgo. The suicide bombers were identified as Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and Bana Jundullah. The group also claimed four military vehicles were destroyed. In February, about 20 soldiers were also killed in Malari, Borno State by the insurgents. SaharaReporters gathered that the soldiers were on patrol to clear some Boko Haram elements in the area following a credible intelligence when they were ambushed by the group.
