SaharaReporters learnt that the victims are civilians. File photo used to illustrate story. They have been arrested by the Nigerian Army since November and December 2020, and later found to be in a base in Niger State. According to a civil group, International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law, the families and lawyers of most of the victims have “not been allowed to see them till date, and neither have they been charged to court nor given fair trial and fair hearing.” “The 112 mostly Igbo civilian residents of Obigbo residency have for almost nine months remained in the Nigerian Army’s Alpha Military Commando Base located along Bida-Suleja Road, Bida in Niger State. They have also been held secretly without administrative or court bail. “Following the discovery of some secret locations where the abductees were taken to and held, in addition to public and media outcries and efforts of Barrister Richard Okoroafor, Intersociety and leadership of the Indigenous People of Biafra, 283 were judicially rescued and over 270 have remained in secret custody of the Nigerian Army. “Another 26 of them were secretly transferred by soldiers to DSS detention facilities in Abuja. It must also be remembered that it was in the course of locating the whereabouts of the 112 Obigbo civilian abductees that Barr Richard Okoroafor, an International human rights lawyer, narrowly escaped being assassinated on February 25, 2021, by killer operatives suspected to be working for the government along the Suleja-Abuja Highway. “The lawyer’s mother was also on May 19 assassinated by suspected hired gunmen at the entrance of her residence in Ekiti State,” the group said in its report sent to SaharaReporters on Tuesday.
