The Yoruba freedom fighter, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, has boasted in a video that he cannot be intimidated or arrested by security agents in Nigeria. In a video obtained by SaharaReporters, Sunday disclosed that if 1,000 policemen come to his house in Ibadan to arrest him, all of them might not return.  “If you want to arrest me, come. I live in Soka. Make sure you come with a net and wheelbarrow. And don’t come at night. If about 1,000 of you come at night, if 100 return, it means you use spiritual powers to disappear. "I am not the type that can be intimidated by the police,” he said. Some operatives of the Department of State Services last week invaded the Sola residence of Igboho, where they killed two of his associates and arrested 13. They also claimed that arms, ammunition and charms were recovered from his residence.
