Do you have a knack for speaking truth to power with facts and reason? Here is an opportunity to join SaharaReporters as a columnist. We are looking for writers who can write informed articles on topical issues (local, national and regional) and who can provoke thoughts and conversations on public policies, trending national stories and how they affect the many communities we serve. Experience in writing opinion articles is grand, but we require more than that. Our ideal candidate is a courageous writer who is angry about the mediocrity and ineptitude in governance and who can stir the fire for repositioning.  We seek writers who can be the voice for the oppressed and confidently write on themes that define and advance our core mission: to expose corruption and government malfeasance, promote citizens rights and uphold the democratic principles that guarantee a just society. How to apply Please send us a cover letter that describes your background, passion, and expertise and why you are the ideal candidate for the position. Also attach your CV and two sample columns of a maximum of 800 words each on related topics to editor@saharareporters.com with "columnist" as the subject line.Â  Previously published articles are acceptable. The deadline to submit your application is July 31. About Us SaharaReporters.com is an outstanding, groundbreaking news website that encourages citizen journalists to report ongoing corruption and government malfeasance in Africa. Using photos, text, and video dynamically, the site informs and prompts concerned African citizens and activists globally to act, denouncing officially-sanctioned corruption, the material impoverishment of its citizenry, defilement of the environment, and the callous disregard of the democratic principles enshrined in the constitution.
