A human rights organisation, Women Empowerment and Legal Aid (WELA), has petitioned the Chief Coroner of the Hight Court of Lagos State to investigate the death of a 14-year-old girl, Jumoke Oyeleke who was allegedly killed by the Police during the Yoruba Nation rally in Lagos on Saturday. In the letter obtained by SaharaReporters on Monday, dated July 5, 2021 and signed by Funmi Falana, the group said the coroner’s inquest will shed more light into the girl’s death.  She was allegedly hit by a police stray bullet “in a violent, unnatural or suspicious situation.” The letter seeks a probe into the death of a young trader, Jumoke, whom policemen in their bid to disperse Yoruba nation agitators allegedly accidentally killed on Saturday.

A young trader, Jumoke Oyeleke, who was hit by stray bullet gave up the ghost. “In the light of the foregoing, we request you to use your good offices to cause a coroner’s inquest to be conducted into the tragic death of Jumoke Oyeleke and make appropriate recommendations pursuant to Section 15 of the Lagos State Coroner’s Law 2007 which provides that an 'an inquest shall hold whenever a Coroner is informed that the death of a deceased person within his Coroner District as a result of death in a violent, unnatural or suspicious situation'. “It will be appreciated if the inquest is conducted without delay and the report made public to forestall such ugly occurrence.” Coroner Inquest - Jumoke Oyeleke by Sahara Reporters on Scribd
