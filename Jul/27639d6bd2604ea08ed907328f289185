The World Igbo Congress, a pressure group, has declared to stage a global protest on Wednesday against the continued detention of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra. According to the statement signed by its Chairman of the Board of Directors, Prof. Anthony Ejiofor, the slated universal demonstration will also alert the world of the incessant killings of the ethnic nationalities of the Southern Kaduna and South-West region of Nigeria dominated by Christians. Nnamdi Kanu WIC Public Relations Officer, Basil Onwukwe, in a statement, on Monday, said that the worldwide protest will also serve as a demand for the immediate release of Kanu, who was arrested by the Nigeria government from Kenya and currently being detained in the custody of the Department for State Service in Abuja. Onwukwe specified that the protest rallies were long overdue because Christians all over Nigeria today live under the danger of the shoot-at-sight directive by the Nigerian government for kicking against the lopsided behaviour of the government. “World Igbo Congress is using the protest to alert the international community to stop any agreements or assistance to Nigeria that overtly or covertly has the potential to enable the looming genocide through acts of government and the Foreign Office. “We also request for an immediate release of Nnamdi Kanu who was recently illegally arrested by the Nigerian government in connivance with the government of Kenya. He is the leader of IPOB. Demanding fairness and true leadership of his people is not a crime,” WIC stated. According to Onwukwe, “WIC will continue the pursuit of the referendum because it is the inalienable right of indigenous people of the world to self-determination like recently happened in Britain (Brexit) and Scotland to determine our peaceful state of actualisation.”
