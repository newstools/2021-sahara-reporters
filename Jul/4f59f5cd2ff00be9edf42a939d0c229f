President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday expressed shock over the death of a Zamfara state lawmaker, Muhammad Ahmad, who was killed by suspected bandits while driving to Kano along Shema-Funtua Road, Katsina state. The lawmaker was killed on Tuesday hours after he defected with Governor Bello Matawalle to the All Progressives Congress (APC).  In a condolence message by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari said, “I am deeply shocked by the tragic circumstances in which the lawmaker died while driving his son to Kano to board a flight.” The President reiterated his directive to law enforcement agencies and the military to deal sternly with anti-social elements bent on harming innocent citizens and creating fear and uncertainties under whatever guise. “May Allah forgive the soul of the deceased and grant his family the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss,” he prayed.
