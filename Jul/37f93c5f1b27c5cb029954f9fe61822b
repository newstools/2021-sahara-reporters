A 14-year-old girl, identified simply as Jumoke, has been killed by bullets fired by security operatives trying to disperse Yoruba Nation agitators at Ojota, Lagos State, on Saturday. The young lady, who was said to be a yoghurt seller, was hit by the bullet in her stomach while running to safety.  According to an older lady, Jumoke was displaying drinks at her shop when the gunshots were heard and while running, she was hit by the bullet. She said, "We were running together, and we got to that spot; that was how the stray bullet hit her. She was beside me." The victim's body has been covered with a piece of cloth as a crowd gathered at the spot.
