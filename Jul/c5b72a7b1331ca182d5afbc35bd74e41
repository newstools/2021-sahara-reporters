Officers of the Department of State Services (DSS) have taken over the Soka residence of the Yoruba freedom fighter, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, popularly called Sunday Igboho. DSS on Thursday night during a press conference in Abuja paraded some exhibits and occupants of his house who were arrested during an invasion of his house earlier in the day.  According to DSS, the items recovered from Igboho's house include Seven (7) AK-47 assault rifles; Three (3) Pump Action guns; Thirty (30) fully charged AK-47 magazines; Five thousand (5,000) rounds of 7.62mm ammunition; Five (5) cutlasses, One (1) Jackknife, One (1) Pen Knife, Two (2) Pistol holsters; One (1) binoculars, wallet containing Five (5) US dollars in one (1) dollar denomination; local and international driver’s licences in his name, ATM cards, and a German residence permit No. YO2N6K1NY bearing his name, among others. Visiting the area on Friday, our correspondent observed that the DSS has taken over the property. Igboho had been at the forefront of the agitation for Yoruba Nation. He was also openly critical of the atrocities committed by suspected Fulani herdsmen in the South-West, who have been accused of raping, killing and kidnapping people for ransom. The President Muhammadu Buhari-led government has failed to solve the problem, leading many farmers to abandon their farms.
