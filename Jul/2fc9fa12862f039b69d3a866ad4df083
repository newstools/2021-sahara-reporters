Ọlagunsoye Oyinlọla, a former Governor of Osun State has said that former President Olusegun Obasanjo warned him and other Yoruba leaders against supporting the candidacy of President Muhammadu Buhari but they did not listen to him. The former governor disclosed this while speaking with BBC Yoruba.  Oyinlola did not specify whether he meant during the 2015 or 2019 general elections. The former governor expressed his displeasure over Buhari’s reversal of his assurance to embark on restructuring – a selling point of his presidency to the Yoruba people during the elections. Oyinlola, who spoke in Yoruba, said, “I am saddened that Buhari did not know what restructuring is now. I know the roles I played for Buhari to become the President of Nigeria but sadly, none of the promises he made had been fulfilled, especially on the security issues. “It was like Boko Haram would be forgotten within six months of Buhari's arrival. Olusegun Obasanjo warned us that Buhari cannot carry the burden of Nigeria but we did not listen to him.”
