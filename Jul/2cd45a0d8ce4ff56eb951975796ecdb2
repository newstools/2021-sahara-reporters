The Senate session, on Thursday, turned rowdy over discussions on the electoral act amendment bill. A heated argument broke out when the Senate deputy whip, Sabi Abdullahi, proposed an amendment to section 50 (3) of the electoral bill, Cable reports.  “The commission may transmit results of elections by electronic means where and when practicable,” the section reads. Abdullahi proposed that the Nigerian Communications Commission must certify that national coverage is adequate and secure while the national assembly must approve before the Independent National Electoral Commission can transmit election results. But Albert Bassey, the Senator representing Akwa Ibom North-East, kicked against the idea and said the initial proposal made by the committee should be retained. The upper legislative chamber subsequently moved into a closed session following the back and forth over the matter.
