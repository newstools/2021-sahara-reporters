The Federal High Court in Abuja has fixed Monday, 26th of July, 2021 to hear an urgent human rights lawsuit filed by five #BuhariMustGo activists arrested by Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Abuja and the Department of State Services (DSS). SaharaReporters had earlier reported that the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court of Nigeria, Honorable Justice John Terhemba Tsoho, refused to assign the case to a judge.  “The Chief Judge of the Federal High Court has failed to assign the lawsuit filed by the #BuhariMustGo activists arrested by Dunamis Church and DSS. The DSS as well still refuses to grant the activists access to their lawyers and families,” a source had told SaharaReporters. The protesters had sued the Director-General of the DSS, Yusuf Magaji Bichi, Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, and Pastor of the church, Paul Enenche over their illegal arrest, detention and human rights violation. The youths have been in detention of the secret police since July 4 for adorning #BuhariMustGo T-shirts at the church.
