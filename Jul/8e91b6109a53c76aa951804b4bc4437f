Several residents of Ebonyi, Abia, Imo, Enugu and Anambra states are currently languishing in correctional centres in Aba, Afaraukwu and other places after the police raided the areas and arrested them. They were accused of being members of the Indigenous People of Biafra.  However, since their arrest and detention, they have not been arraigned or charged for any crime. SaharaReporters obtained some of the names of the victims, in a report compiled by an Anambra State-based civil group, Intersociety for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law – one of the rights groups monitoring developments in the South-East. The report revealed that while about 30 residents were clamped in prison without trial, the whereabouts of others could not be traced as the family members and human rights lawyers continue to search for the locations the security agencies took them to.
