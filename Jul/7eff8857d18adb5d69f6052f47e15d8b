The family members of a beauty make-up artist, Anu Agbalaya, are currently troubled after the lady went to render home service to a client in the Ikorodu area of Lagos State and never returned home. SaharaReporters learnt that Anu, 23, went for the job on July 7 to fix nails for a supposed female client in the area, but she went missing from there and her phone number had been switched off.  SaharaReporters gathered that when the family members fortunately got the number of the client, having spoken with her immediately the beauty artist got to her residence, the woman insisted that Anu had left her residence. The family stay in Ajah area, a suburb of Lagos and the matter has been reported to the Langbasa division. Speaking with SaharaReporters, the elder sister, Tope Agbalaya said the family feared her sister might have fallen into the hands of kidnappers, adding that they received a call from her on “a private number” on Friday but she could not speak for so long. She said, “It was Wednesday she left her house in Ajah that she was going to see a client in the Ikorodu area or home service. That was it. She never came back. We have been trying to call her phone but it is switched off. We called the client she went to fix nails for; she insisted the missing lady left her house that Wednesday. “Our parents are worried and we have gone to file a missing person report at the police station. She is just 23 years old. On Friday, she called through a private number but her voice was dizzy. She could only say she was alive and she was fine. She did not talk for so long.” SaharaReporters learnt that the family members were preparing to go to Ikorodu and also report her case at the police stations there, but they do not know the actual address of the client.
