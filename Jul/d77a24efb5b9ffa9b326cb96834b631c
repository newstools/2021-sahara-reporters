The Oluwo of Iwo, Ọba Abdul-Rasheed Akanbi, has explained the reason for the silence of Yoruba monarchs over the raid on the house of Yoruba rights activist, Sunday Adeyemo, aka  Sunday Igboho by operatives of the Department of State Services. Last Thursday, members of the DSS invaded Igboho's Soka residence, during which two persons were killed and 13 arrested.  The secret police also declared Igboho wanted and the agitator had since gone underground.  But, in an interview with BBC Yoruba, Oluwo gave reasons for the palpable silence of his colleagues.  According to him, many monarchs kept silent over the DSS raid on Igboho’s home because he earlier abused some respected traditional rulers that could easily defend him against “external attacks”.  He stated that many of the monarchs were in support of Igboho’s agitation against killer herdsmen but the Yoruba rights activist ignored some of their warnings.  He said Igboho was cautioned by monarchs about the manner he was agitating for Yoruba Nation but he failed to adjust.  He also accused Igboho and other agitators of the Yoruba Nation of not consulting with Yoruba monarchs properly.  He opined that the fight for the Yoruba Nation will be more productive with the inputs of the traditional rulers.  Oluwo, who spoke in Yoruba, said, “They forgot that the king superintends over everything and government has a duty to secure its citizens.  “The government cannot fold its hands again and allow a repeat of what happened during #EndSARS.  “We must be diplomatic with our demands. We cannot get our demand by fighting the government. Instead, we can negotiate and dialogue with the government.”
