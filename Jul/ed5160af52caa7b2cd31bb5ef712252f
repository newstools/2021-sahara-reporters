0 Comments
6 Days Ago The church security team was said to have arrested the activists and handed them over to the DSS, Nigeria's secret police. Speaking to SaharaReporters, a top official of the DSS said the five #BuhariMustGo campaigners were still being detained because of two stories written by the newspaper against the cleric and his father-in-law. He said, “Don’t be deceived, Dr. Enenche is actually lying about working to get them released. Backstage, he (Enenche) doesn’t want them released except SaharaReporters deletes the story written against his father in-law and another one written against the church last year, I think it was a story about a former pastor of the church accusing Eneche of sending him to prison on trumped-up charges. “He told us it was Omoyele Sowore that sent the boys to his church and he (Sowore) should be punished by the prolonged detention of the guys.” SaharaReporters on June 27, 2020 published that one Pastor Abraham Daniel, a former member of Dunamis International Gospel Centre revealed how Eneche falsely accused him and had him imprisoned on trumped-up charges.

Nigerian Cleric Reveals How Pastor Eneche Of Dunamis Church Had Him Imprisoned On False Charges
0 Comments
1 Year Ago Daniel claimed Eneche and other pastors were angry at him for leaving the church while also claiming that he (Daniel) publicly criticised the cleric in his Facebook posts that revealed the activities of the church. He added that while he was in prison, he lost his business and his wife also left with their five children after being influenced by the church. He said, "I was ordained as a pastor in 2010. In 2014, I was posted to New Karu as the residence pastor. While I was there, we started a school. I wanted a school that would be almost free for church members but an instruction came from the headquarters that I should not run the school freely, so I had to stop the whole plan. "I wrote on my Facebook post telling churches in Nigeria to encourage members' development and also help members. I also wrote that Christians now celebrate pastors instead of focusing on Jesus and the teachings of the Bible. "I later lost interest in the church, wrote a letter of resignation, it was accepted and I left. The pastor (Eneche) called me and was insulting me because I left the church. He sent his pastors to start calling my wife to pester me to return to the church. "This put my family in disarray as my wife pestered me until I closed the ministry and ensured I returned to Dunamis Church. I left again, then suddenly things went rogue. A number called me that he needed my Uber service and we met unknowingly to me that they were police. "They took me to Karu Police Station, saying that they arrested me because of what I wrote against Pastor Eneche." He added that he was moved to another police station in Abuja and the church insisted that he must be taken to court. He was eventually charged to court and remanded in prison pending his bail application. Daniel also said the church made false allegations while testifying in court, which made the judge send him to prison before he was granted another bail. The newspaper in 2021 also reported how the Chairman of Benue State University Teaching Hospital and the father of Enenche's wife, Becky, Professor John Ibu, was arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for alleged N24.6 million fraud.
