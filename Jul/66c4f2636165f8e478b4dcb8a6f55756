The roof of the National Assembly Complex again leaked as it rained heavily on Monday. It was gathered that the main lobby which leads to the chambers of the Senate and the House of Representatives looked like a fish pond during the downpour that lasted for some hours. Domestic staff members of the assembly battled for several minutes to drain out the pool of water. This comes a few days after a similar incident occurred, a development that led to an altercation between the National Assembly and the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA). See Also
