The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, who has been in the custody of the Nigeria's secret police since last week Tuesday would soon regain freedom, according to his lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor. Ejiofor, who represents the IPOB leader, stated this while stressing that the Nigerian government does not possess any strong evidence to use in convicting Kanu. IPOB Leader, Nnamdi Kanu In the statement made on Thursday, according to Daily Post, Ejiofor appealed to Kanu’s supporters to be patient and prayerful.  Ejiofor said, “We are in high spirits that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will soon come out of detention sooner than expected, and better too. It’s one thing for allegations to be made; it’s another thing to establish it. But I don’t think there’s anything strong enough to convict him.”  He also commented on what to expect during the July 26 court hearing.  He said: “Nothing extraordinary will happen that day. That I can assure you. We’ll be there as usual to entertain applications. If there’s any amendment, we’ll take it up from there.  “What we have is still the 3 counts. We also have an application overdue for hearing, that is the invasion of his house where 28 persons were killed.  “We have all the pictorial evidence. We’ll tender them before the court so the court will look at them to ensure justice.”  Kanu had in 2017 fled Nigeria to Europe, where he operated.  But, a few weeks ago, the Nigerian government rearrested him in Kenya and extradited him to Nigeria to continue his trial.  He was brought before Justice Binta Nyako, who remanded him in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS).
