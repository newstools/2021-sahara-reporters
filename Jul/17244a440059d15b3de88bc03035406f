A six-year-old boy has been reportedly brutalised and abused by his father at the Jeddo area of Otokutu in Delta State. In a video obtained by SaharaReporters, the boy is interviewed.  The boy, who has sustained head injuries, noted that he did not wear trousers because they were dirty. He said he did not have money to buy soap. "I stay in Jeddo with my dad and sister. My daddy gave me all the marks (injuries) on my head, he said I am stubborn. I am not putting on trousers because they are dirty and I'm still looking for money to buy soap. "I have not eaten since morning," he added. According to Warri Aproko Special, the neighbours said attempts to rescue the boy from his allegedly abusive father or prevent the abuse were not successful. A source said sometimes, the father would chain the little boy in a cage for weeks without giving him food. The source said the boy fed on the blocks used to build the cage.
