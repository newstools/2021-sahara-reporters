No fewer than 52 senators of the National Assembly voted against the electronic transmission of election results by the Independent National Electoral Commission – a decision which many Nigerians have condemned saying the "lawmakers live in the Stone Age" and wish to suppress the will of the people.  Among the 52 are 50 members of the All Progressives Congress in the Senate and two of their counterparts in the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party. They had on Thursday voted against electronic transmission of election results in the forthcoming general elections. Notwithstanding the constitutionally guaranteed independence of the electoral body, the senators insisted that INEC should also be compelled to seek clearance from the Nigerian Communications Commission, over the issue.
