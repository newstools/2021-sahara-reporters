A 200-level student of the Niger Delta University, Bayelsa, identified as Jennifer Ugadu, has been found dead in her room at an off-campus hostel of the institution.  Ugadu was a student of the Faculty of Education.  While details of the incident were still sketchy when filing this report, SaharaReporters gathered that a bullet allegedly used by the killer was found in the deceased room.   Her roommate also fingered her boyfriend, who is a military officer, James Azeez as the killer.  She claimed to have given the key to the room where Ugudu's body was kept to Azeez while traveling.  "I was about to travel to Yenagoa when her boyfriend, James Azeez, came to the house, and I welcomed him. I told him that his girlfriend (Jennifer Ugadu) had traveled for a holiday and had not resumed school.  "I called my friend, and I told her that her boyfriend was around but she said she wasn't coming back because she had issues with him. Since he's someone I know, I left the room for him and gave him the key, and I traveled to Yenagoa.  "After some days, I tried her number and it wasn't going through. I called her boyfriend and he said he had gone back to Maiduguri because he's a soldier. He said he had been calling her but she didn't respond to the call.  "I had to call my neighbor this morning to check my room if there's anyone, only for my neighbor to open the window and find her dead in blood," the deceased roommate told SaharaReporters.  SaharaReporters, however, gathered that Ugudu's killer has her phone.  According to different posts dropped in a WhatsApp group with the deceased number, the killer claimed he was ready to die as well.  "You are very funny, the day I killed her, I called my mom and told her; her aunt is also aware. I'm also prepared to die because I wanted to commit suicide because of her. But I want her to go with me. So don't trouble yourself. Cuz, I'm going to die also," the WhatsApp posts read.
