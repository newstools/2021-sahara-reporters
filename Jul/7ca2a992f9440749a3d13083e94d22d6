A Nigerian senator has reeled out personal mid-term achievements to include N109 million worth of COVID-19 palliatives distributed to her supporters. Senator Aisha Ahmed Binani (Adamawa Central) also reflected in her mid-term scorecard how some members of her party, the All Progressives Congress, shared N17,460,000 federal government interventions.  Senator Binani is a cousin of the First Lady, Aisha Buhari. In a three-page scorecard read to cheering APC members in Adamawa state, Binani said she influenced the distribution of various federal government empowerment packages to party members. Her scorecard was presented during a special event to celebrate President Muhammadu Buhari's various projects executed in Adamawa state from 2019 to June 2021. The breakdown as made public by the Adamawa state chapter of the APC, indicated that Senator Binani distributed N1 million each to 109 beneficiaries as part of federal government COVID-19 palliatives. The document which read in part, further revealed, "300 persons benefitted N20,000 each from FGN intervention."382 persons benefitted N30,000 each from FGN-SF." This, however, runs contrary to Buhari's social investment programmes, designed to cushion the effects of hardship faced by Nigerians irrespective of party affiliation. Many Nigerians and constituents of the female senator, who are not members of any political party have asked how one senator could access so much funds. Hameed Arabo, a social justice activist said, "It is ridiculous that a million naira in cash was given to each of the 109 persons as palliative? This is simply laughable."Granted, she distribute N109 million to 109 persons; let her (Binani) publish the names of the beneficiaries."
