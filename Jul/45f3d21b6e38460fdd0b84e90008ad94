1 Day Ago "The five activists arrested at Dunamis are being detained by DSS director of FCT. They have been deprived of food and sleep since arrest,” a top source revealed. The activists had been manhandled and beaten by the DSS operatives on the church premises, who also seized their mobile phones. Human rights activists, Omoyele Sowore and Deji Adeyanju, had met with Enenche over the arrest of the activists. While clarifying the matter, Sowore said the pastor denied claims by some persons that the activists were trying to disrupt the church service. “We are adults and if we are tired of the system and we say the system must collapse, it is our right to express ourselves freely. I told the pastor when he said he was not happy when the activists were trying to protest within the premises that with the way things are going on, more and more people will be wearing #BuhariMustGo T-shirts to the church because people are tired of Buhari regime. "We have a respectable agreement and some disagreements over this issue but what is important to me and why I don't want to drag this for too long is the release of these individuals from detention. "We are going to wait till evening because we requested that they should be released today (Monday). Nobody knows their whereabouts. We don't know whether they have been fed or they have been tortured," Sowore had said.
