An online news platform, WikkiTimes has insisted that its story on how the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara allegedly connived with the Universal Basic Education Commission to embezzle N1 billion meant for a school project is true, accurate, and credible. WikkiTimes' investigation had revealed how N1 billion constituency projects nominated by the former Speaker to build model schools in Bauchi South Federal Constituency were mismanaged.  The publisher, Haruna Mohammed Salisu, said, “We have come across viral publications suggesting that WikkiTimes had published a ‘libellous’ report against the former Speaker. Although we are not officially served any letter by any purported law chamber, I feel we need to put the records straights. We stand by our story. “It’s within his prerogative to go court if he feels our story is a misrepresentation of facts. But let me also reiterate that before our story was published, we contacted Yakubu Dogara and gave him enough time to respond but he ignored numerous calls and text.”

6 Days Ago Salisu further stated that WikkiTimes would not retract the story as demanded by Dogara “because it’s indeed very laughable for a credible medium such as WikkiTimes to retract a painstaking investigation backed by facts. “We know that Dogara nominated the N1 billion school projects and there is open and available evidence in the public domain that can justify this for any reasonable person to see. We equally know that it was based on Mr. Dogara’s consent that the contracts were awarded. Therefore, he ought to supervise the projects and ensure they were diligently executed." Haruna said that “he cannot cry wolf when it’s apparent that he’s categorically failed to do his work. Our story remains, and we will be happy to meet Mr. Dogara in court.”
