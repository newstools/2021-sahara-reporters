Remilekun, the wife of an Ogun State activist, Kunle Garb, who was arrested by Benin Republic police in Nigeria two weeks ago, has decried the alleged maltreatment of her husband. Speaking with PUNCH, Remilekun alleged that the Benin Republic police subjected her husband to inhuman treatment in the cell for resisting the security operatives from encroaching on Nigerian land.  Garb was earlier arrested and detained by the Benin Republic for resisting moves to encroach on Nigerian land through Igbokofi village in the Yewa-North local government area of Ogun state. The development has generated concerns while the state government also called for help from the Federal Government to rescue Garb. In a related development, the wife said another Nigerian, Benjamin Amosu, had also been arrested and detained for offering to serve as Garb’s interpreter in the court. Garb’s wife said, “A Beninese was interpreting for Garb but was implicating him. So, Amosu asked the man to step aside while he interpreted for him. "After the court session, he was arrested and detained. “They are taking Amosu to court on Monday, while my husband will be in court on July 13. "He was later transferred to Porto-Novo and an attempt to get him food was blocked. They did not allow anyone to see him. Government should intervene in this matter.”
