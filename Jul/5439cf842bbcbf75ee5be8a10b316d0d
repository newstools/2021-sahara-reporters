The Ibaji Progressive Youth Foundation, a group in the Ibaji Local Government Area of Kogi State, has filed a suit against the council Chairman, Williams Iko-ojo Obiora, for violating their rights and moving the Ibaji Liason Office another council, Idah. The group stated that such step by the Obiora-led Ibaji local government is a desecration of their political representation and economic opportunities.  In a copy of the lawsuit dated June 28, 2021, filed before a High Court of Justice in Lokoja and made available to SaharaReporters on Thursday, the appellants sought that “the Defendants have no power or competence to suspend or relocate Ibaji Liason Office from Onyedega down to Idah for whatsoever reason.” According to the summons taken out by V.A Ocheja, there was a declaration, “that the steps so far taken and the decision of the Ibaji Local Government Area Council in relocating the administrative offices such as Liason Office to Idah is a denial of the rights of Ibaji to fair political representation and denial of access to economic opportunities as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” The group in the suit which partly reads further asks, “An Order for the relocation of all administrative offices belonging to Ibaji Local Government from Idah back to Onyedega, the local government Headquarters of Ibaji. “An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the Defendant from further running or carrying out affairs of Ibaji local government in a different local government other than Ibaji; and from immediate relocation of Ibaji Local Government Liason office back to Onyedega.”
