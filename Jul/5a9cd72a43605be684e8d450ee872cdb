The Lagos State Police Command on Thursday arrested a woman, Mrs. Sharon Williams, for allegedly locking up a five-year-old boy over six months in the Ijede area of Ikorodu. SaharaReporters learnt that the boy identified as Michael Ibiyome had been put under house arrest by his 43-year-old aunt and he was found with a deep injury on his head.  He was reportedly kept behind a fridge. According to an executive of the Child Protection Network, a civil society, Alhaji Lateef Akinborode, the report on the locking up of Ibiyome was received from the state Ministry of Youths and Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation. The boy, who has been denied rights to education, food and healthcare for the period of six months, was thereafter taken to Ijede General Hospital for medical treatment. Alhaji Akinborode said the boy was rescued with the joint forces of the Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps and the Nigerian Police Force. Speaking with SaharaReporters, Akinborode said, “A report got to us from the Ministry of Youths through the Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation about a boy who has been locked up for over six months with a woman reported to be his aunt. The boy had been denied access to education, feeding, health care, love, affection and free movement. “After several attempts to gain access into the house of the perpetrator with the support of the police failed, she eventually opened the door and was arrested. The boy was found behind a fridge in the sitting room with a very deep cut on his head and several injuries on his body. “His hands are already stiff as a result of being tied up for too long. He was rescued and he is currently receiving treatment at the Ijede General Hospital.”
