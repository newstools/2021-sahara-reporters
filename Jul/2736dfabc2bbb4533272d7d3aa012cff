One of the next-door neighbours of Chief Sunday Adeyemo, popularly called Sunday Igboho has revealed that a white Cross Country transport branded bus was used to evacuate those allegedly killed at the residence of Igboho on Thursday morning. The neighbour, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of attack, said she was peeping from her window during the invasion.  According to her, at least, five military men were stationed in front of each of some three houses she could see from her room. She confirmed some military men and operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) arrived at the house around 1:30am and left around 4:30am, adding that a domestic worker and one  Alfa were killed. The source said the "Alfa was killed while praying," adding that she saw three corpses and not five as some people had claimed. She said many residents in the house were taken away. "This is my house. I was peeping from my room when I started hearing noises. They arrived around 1:30am and left around 4:30am. "At least, for those three houses, I saw a minimum of five military men in front of each of them. They evacuated the remains of those killed with a Cross Country bus. I saw it and I am sure. I saw Alfa and another domestic worker when they took them out with bloodstains. They dragged their bodies on the floor. I don't know the other person but I saw him dead. I heard here this morning that Alfa was praying when they shot him. I don't know what happened inside the compound but I saw what happened outside. "Other occupants were taken away. One of them known as Lady K was also taken away. I saw Lady K before she went to bed last night. The man, Igboho is a nice man. He is very generous and kind. Many of the people living here are his relations."
