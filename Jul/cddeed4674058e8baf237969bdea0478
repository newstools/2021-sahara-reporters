Uchenna was arrested with substances suspected to be cocaine valued at N150 million, and a measuring scale after a search in his residence at Umuaka, Njaba local government area of Imo State. The suspects were apprehended following diligent intelligence gathering that led to the arrest of one Obinna Ohaji who disguised as a driver in search of passengers in a Nissan Caravan bus, a police source said. The source also disclosed that a large quantity of cocaine was recovered from the bus after a search. The driver, who confessed that the cocaine was given to him to deliver to an unknown lady at Elele in Rivers State, led the police to the border between Imo and Rivers state where the receiver, a 17-year-old girl, who confessed to be the groupâ€™s supplier in Rivers, was arrested. The Imo police spokesman, Michael Abattam, who said the suspects were possibly the ones who distributed the drugs to various terror camps in the state, noted that investigation is ongoing to trace the source of the hard drugs into the state and also to arrest other members of the syndicate in hiding.
