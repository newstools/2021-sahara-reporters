The Senior Pastor of the Dunamis International Gospel Centre (Glory Dome), Abuja, Paul Enenche, has secretly laid off the Department of State Services lead agent of the church as part of a plot to absolve the church of the continued detention of the five #BuhariMustGo protesters. SaharaReporters learnt on Thursday that Enenche let go of the church’s DSS lead agent to cover up the church’s involvement all along in the arrest and detention of the activists. The activists, including a blind church saxophonist, have now spent about two weeks in the DSS detention as families also worry about their welfare and medical care. The detained activists are; Ben Manasseh, Emmanuel Larry, Samuel Gabriel, Anene Victor Udoka, and Henry Nwodo. Last Sunday, the family members of the protesters had stormed the Glory Dome in Abuja to protest against the continued detention of their wards, but they were also roundly harassed and molested by the security agents who had mobilised to the premises in large numbers.

4 Days Ago SaharaReporters learnt on Thursday that Pastor Enenche had taken a step further to cover up the church's role in the arrest and detention of the protesters. “Pastor Enenche in an attempt to cover up the involvement of the church in the matter has asked the lead DSS agent in the church, who the church used in handing them over to the DSS, to leave the church for now. “Enenche also admitted to the church elders that approached him on the matter that he initially consented to handing them over to the DSS to show to the Buhari regime that he was opposed to the #BuhariMustGo campaign and to punish Sowore for negative reporting against his church,” a top source said. SaharaReporters had on July 9 reported that the five protesters dragged the church and the DSS to court over their illegal arrest, detention and violation of their human rights.
