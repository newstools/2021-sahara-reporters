The Sultan of Sokoto and President-General, Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, has announced that Sunday, July 11, will be the first day of Dhul-Hijja 1442AH.  This was contained in a statement on Sunday signed by Prof. Sambo Junaidu, Chairman, Advisory Committee on Religious Affairs, Sultanate Council, Sokoto.  “The Sultanate Council Advisory Committee on Religious Affairs in Conjunction with the National Moon Sighting Committee on Saturday received reports on the sighting of the crescent of Dhul-Hijja 1442AH.  “The Sultan accepted the report and accordingly declared Sunday, July 11, as the first day of Dhul-Hijja 1442AH,” it read in part.  Dhul-Hijja is the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, in which Muslims perform the Ḥajj (Holy Pilgrimage) as well as observe the Festival of Sacrifice.  Nigerian Muslims will now observe the 2021 Eid-el-Kabir on Tuesday, July 20, which is equivalent to 10th of Dhul-Hijja 1442AH.
