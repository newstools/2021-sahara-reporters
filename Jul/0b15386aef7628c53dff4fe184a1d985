The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, has stated that he received over 900 text messages in one day over allegations of tampering with the report of the Electoral Act. He described those accusing the leaders of the National Assembly of removing electronic transmission of results from the report as mischievous and rabble-rousers. Senate President Ahmad Lawan Lawan stated this shortly after the Chairman of the committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Senator Kabiru Gaya, submitted a report of the committee. Explaining that this is the first time the committee is submitting its report on the Electoral Act to the Senate, Lawan said, “There are various accusations and insinuations that leaders of the National Assembly have tempered with the report of the INEC committee. In one day, I received 900 text messages.” Recall that Nigerians and civil society organisations had alleged that the final copy of the Bill did not represent the interest of Nigerian people and therefore urged Nigerians to consider it as a forged document that must not be substituted for legitimate demands. It was alleged that leadership of the National Assembly expunged some items which included; electronic transmission of results and limitations on campaign expenses.
