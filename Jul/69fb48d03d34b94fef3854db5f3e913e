The family of Jumoke Oyeleke, the teenager killed during the ‘Yoruba Nation’ rally in Lagos has narrated how men of the Lagos State Police Command demanded over N200,000 as ‘burial expenses’ from them. On July 3, the police shot into the air and fired teargas as they dispersed ‘Yoruba Nation’ agitators at Gani Fawehinmi Park.  Amid the ensuing melee, the 14-year-old was found dead in a pool of blood after a stray bullet from police gunshots was said to have hit her. The police however denied the culpability of its officers in the death of the girl while the state government ordered an investigation into the matter.
