A Federal High Court sitting in Lagos State on Wednesday admitted more exhibits in evidence in the ongoing trial of popular hip hop singer, Azeez Fashola, otherwise known as Naira Marley. Justice Nicolas Oweibo in his ruling admitted the compact disc containing the phone analysis of the embattled singer which was tendered in evidence by the second prosecution witness, Anosike Augustine, on the grounds that the iPhone which was analysed had been admitted in evidence before.  The judge overruled the objection Naira Marley's counsel, Olalekan Ojo (SAN), raised and admitted the CD in evidence marked exhibit F. “l have considered the agreement of both parties as well as the grounds for the objection, I consider the CD to be admissible in view of the nature of this case and the evidence of other prosecution witnesses. “Accordingly, it is hereby admitted in evidence and marked exhibit F.” The trial of the case could not proceed because defence counsel Olalekan Ojo was not in court and sought for adjournment. The adjournment was not opposed by the counsel for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Bilkisu Buhari. Justice Oweibo adjourned further trial to March 8 and 11, 2021. According to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the anti-graft agency had on May 20, 2019 arraigned Naira Marley on 11 counts bordering on money laundering and Internet fraud. The EFCC alleged that some of the credit cards discovered in his residence bore the names Nicole Louise Malyon and Timea Fedorne Tatar. But he pleaded not guilty to all the charges. The EFCC said that the offences contravened the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act and the Cyber Crimes Act.
