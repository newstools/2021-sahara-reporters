President Muhammadu Buhari's Senior Special Assistant on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, has said accusing Fulani herdsmen of being responsible for every heinous act perpetrated by criminals is evil, noting that every tribe in the country has bad eggs. She alleged that many critics of the Buhari administration were driven by hate and bitterness, and criminalising Fulani herdsmen was an act of fishing for trouble. Lauretta Onochie In a string of tweets on Monday, the President’s aide said all crimes committed in non-Fulani host communities were attributed to guest -herders- who are of the same tribe as Buhari. Onochie, who was reacting to statements made by a human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), on the eviction order issued by Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, that herdsmen should leave the state’s forest reserves within seven days, said, “If there is an ethnic or community clash where lives and property are lost, we pick and choose which to attribute to community clash and which to lay on the doorstep of the Fulanis, Buhari’s ethnic group, in order to satisfy the craving for more bitterness and hatred towards Buhari.

But criminalising an ethnic group because you don't like President Buhariâs face, is nothing short of evil and fishing for trouble. #CrimeHasNoTribe #CrimeHasNoReligion #HoldTheCriminalNotHisTribe #ThereAreBadEggsInEveryTribe  “There is no tribe that is free of bad eggs. But criminalising an ethnic group because you don’t like President Buhari’s face, is nothing short of evil and fishing for trouble.” The President’s aide further said the critics of the regime have insatiable demands. “They had asked for restructuring. Buhari has no power to alter the constitution so he did what is within his power…After restructuring, they moved to Fulani herdsmen and Boko Haram." She, however, called for peace amid the situations in Ondo and Oyo states, adding that elections remained the constitutional way to remove an unpopular government. “Those threatening mayhem must calm down, take a deep breath and remember that this is the only nation we can truly call 'ours'. “The ballot box is usually, the best way to change a government. That is in 2023. Let common sense prevail. God bless Nigeria,” she tweeted.
