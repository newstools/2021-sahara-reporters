The petition had claimed that Thomas died of depression after discovering that his two children with Moyo, his ex-wife and former employee of the bank, belong to Nuru.

2 Days Ago Thomas reportedly died of depression, after he realised that Nuru allegedly fathered the two children he thought he had with Moyo. Although the FCMB has said it is investigating the scandal against its MD, a petition has already been raised by concerned Nigerians, demanding that Nuru must be sacked and prosecuted. According to the petition, Moyo allegedly informed her husband that she was leaving Nigeria for the United States with the kids, only to call him upon arrival that the children did not belong to him. The petition claimed the news initially caused Thomas to have a stroke but later recovered and thereafter met another lady whom he planned to marry. He was however said to have suffered cardiac arrest after returning from work about two days before an event organised for his relations and the family of his fiancée to get to know each other, was to be held. His fiancée was said to have been pregnant at the time. No fewer than 2,400 petitioners had signed a petition calling for the sacking of the FCMB MD over the marriage scandal as of Sunday afternoon.
