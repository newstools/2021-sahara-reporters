The police boss added, "The governors of Lagos, Niger, Edo, and Nasarawa states have made commitments to meet the financial requirements for the officers. "Four states: Anambra, Borno, Kwara and Osun states have yet to undertake the recruitment and training, but modalities for the exercise were perfected with the state governors. "We have been receiving special requests from some state governors for the recruitment, training, kitting and deployment of additional CPOs to their respective states." President Muhammadu Buhari, who was represented by the Minister of Police Affairs, Mohammed Dingyadi, said CPOs would change the narratives of policing in Nigeria and strengthen trust and partnership with the citizens. The acting chairman of the National Salaries and Wages Commission, Ekpo Nta, said a new salary structure for police officers would soon be approved. Nta, who was represented by Secretary to the Commission, David Nyikyaa, maintained that all documentation had been completed but awaiting submission to the president for approval.
