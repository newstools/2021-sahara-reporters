Some suspected Fulani herdsmen have burnt about ten acres of cashew farm, near Wakili Fulani village, Kajola Ayete, Ibarapa North Local Government Area of Oyo State. SaharaReporters learnt that the farm, belonging to a 90-year-old Yoruba man, Chief Oyewole, was burnt because the nonagenarian was one of those who had complained about the criminal activities of Fulani herdsmen in his village.

Guardian Nigeria Our correspondent gathered that seven youths on Wednesday went to the Fulani settlement to inform Wakili, the Fulani leader in the area, about some criminal activities his children were doing and invite him to the palace of a traditional leader in the town. Our source however said that on getting to the village, Wakili and his men shot four farmers and quickly went to burn the farm close to his settlement. Confirming the development to SaharaReporters, Chief Saubana Omileke Oyewole, Odomofin of Ayete, said the farm that was destroyed belongs to his elder brother. He described Wakili as a monster in Ayete, while likening him to the Seriki Fulani of Igangan, Alhaji Saliu Abdulkadir, whose house and cars were recently burnt by some youths in Igangan and had to flee the community. The arson attack followed a seven-day ultimatum given by a Yoruba activist popularly known as Sunday Igboho to Fulani herdsmen in the area to leave, blaming them for the spate of kidnappings and killings in the area.
