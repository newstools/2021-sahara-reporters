The National Identity Management Commission has shut down its headquarters in Abuja and stopped the National Identity Number enrolment activities to avoid the spread of COVID-19. According to NIMC Spokesman, Kayode Adegoke, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, gave the directive on Saturday.  SaharaReporters had reported how large crowds visited the NIMC offices across the country for NIN registration. The development comes after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) directed telecommunications companies to block SIM cards not registered with the NIN. See Also
