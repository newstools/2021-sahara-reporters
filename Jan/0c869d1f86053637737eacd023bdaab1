The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, has urged Nigerians to do everything possible to secure their National Identity Numbers (NINs). This comes amidst rising anxieties over SIM-NIN connection by many mobile network subscribers in the country.  On Monday, the minister urged Nigerians to secure and protect their NINs, and desist from selling their NINs or allowing others to use their NINs for registration. He stated this at the end of a review meeting of the Technical Implementation Committee under the Ministerial Task Force, on Monday. Pantami said, “For any action committed with the SIM, good or bad, it will be officially traced and attached to the NIN owner." See Also
