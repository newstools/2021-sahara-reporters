But a total of 233,000 candidates, who were prevented from taking the NECO examination in some states due to the #EndSARS protests would be accommodated in the external examination scheduled for between Monday, February 1 and Wednesday, March 3 2021.  The states affected by the protest are Abia, Enugu, Edo, River, Ondo, Ekiti, Osun, Lagos, Oyo, Kano, Ogun and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. A comparative analysis of results released by NECO for two years showed that a total of 829,787 candidates, representing 71.59 per cent, scored a total of five credits, including English and Mathematics in the year 2019, as against the year 2020 where 894,101 candidates, representing 73.89 per cent scored five credits, including Mathematics and English.
