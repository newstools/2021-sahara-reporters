A 20-year-old woman, Opeyemi Olatoke, who had been locked inside an abandoned house by her family members for over five years has been rescued by the Osun State government with the help of the Nigeria Police Force. Opeyemi was rescued at her family house located at Alfa Fire area, Oke-Iba-Obaagun Road, in Ikirun, Ifelodun Local Government Area of the state.  Her father, identified as Samson Olatoke, who was alleged to have locked up her daughter and her brother, was arrested by the police. The state Commissioner for Women, Children and Social Affairs, Olubukola Olaboopo, in a statement on Monday said the case was reported to her office by a non-governmental organisation, Value Female Network. She said; “The ministry and the police swung into action; we went to the house where the 20-year-old woman was locked up by her father. The father disclosed that he locked up the woman because she was physically challenged. The victim’s mother informed us that Opeyemi’s health started to deteriorate when she shouted in her sleep at age four and that since then, she has been lame." The commissioner urged parents to take good care of their children, saying those found maltreating their wards will be dealt with, according to the laws of the state. The woman’s father, who is the founder of Cherubim and Seraphim, Ileri Ayo parish, Ikirun, said they decided to lock her up due to her health challenge.
