Donald Trump says he won't attend Joe Biden's inauguration as president of the United States on January 20. "To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20," he tweeted on Friday.  The President had earlier issued a broadcast saying he's now focused on delivering a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. He also addressed the US Capitol's invasion by his supporters who were egged on by his claims of widespread voter fraud in the election of November 3, 2020. He said, "I'll like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem. I immediately deployed the National Guard and Federal Law Enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders. America is and must always be a nation of law and order.

10 Hours Ago "The demonstrators who infiltrated the nation's Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy. To those who engaged in acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country. And to those who broke the law, you will pay. "We have just been through an intense election, and emotions are high. Now temper must be cooled and calm restored. We must get on with the business of America. "My campaign vigorously pursued every legal avenue to content the election results. My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote. In so doing, I was fighting to defend America's democracy. I continue to strongly believe that we must reform our election laws to verify all voters' identity and eligibility and to ensure faith and confidence in all future elections. "Now, Congress has certified the results. A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20. My focus now turns to ensure a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.
