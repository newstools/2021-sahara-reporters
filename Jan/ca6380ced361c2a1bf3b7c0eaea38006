10 Hours Ago The matter will now go before the Senate, which will decide whether Trump should be convicted and removed from office. Here are the ten House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump on the charge of incitement of insurrection: John Katko of New York.Liz Cheney of Wyoming.Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.Fred Upton of Michigan.Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state.Dan Newhouse of Washington state.Peter Meijer of Michigan.Tom Rice of South Carolina.Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio.David Valadao of California. The Republicans’ votes made this the most bipartisan presidential impeachment in history. In comparison, five Democrats voted to impeach Bill Clinton in 1998.
