Nigerians have condemned the Nigerian government for arresting the convener of #RevolutionNow, Comrade Omoyele Sowore, and demanded his immediate release from the custody of the Nigeria Police. Sowore, a rights activist, was arrested on Friday in Abuja, the nation’s capital, by Nigerian security forces alongside other activists as they were carrying out a peaceful procession to mark the New Year.  Eyewitnesses confirm policemen suspected to belong to Rapid Response Squad went to Gudu junction in Abuja, wounded Sowore and took him away with other activists at the location. Nigerians have however taken to social media to berate the action of the government against the Amnesty International designated prisoner of conscience was berated. For instance, on Twitter, Nigerians demanded his immediate release, adding that he must not be injured.
