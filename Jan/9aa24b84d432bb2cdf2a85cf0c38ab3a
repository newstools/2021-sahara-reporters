A report released earlier stated that the body was in a serious leadership crisis following the refusal of the NANS President to distribute evenly the Christmas gifts the body had received from an unnamed politician.

8 Hours Ago An aide to the NANS Senate President, who made the allegation also said Asefon was running the union like a family business. However, in separate phone calls to Asefon and Okafor, the duo denied that such a leadership crisis existed. Okafor said there was nothing like that and would not want anyone who claims to be an aide to cause confusion in the union. He said, "I do not have any aide that I have given such an instruction so I'm a little bit confused. I would not want anyone to create a problem when there is none. From which source did the information come from? This information is unverified. There is nothing like that." Asefon, who has always been against granting interviews appeared to be infuriated when SaharaReporters called him and he immediately asked our reporter to call the Senate President.
