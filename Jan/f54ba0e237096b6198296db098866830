A court-martial sitting in Borno State has sentenced Trooper Azunna Maduabuchi to death by firing squad for killing his commander at 202 Battalion of the 21 Special Armoured Brigade in Bama, Lieutenant Babakaka Ngorgi. Maduabuchi was on Tuesday sentenced to death by firing squad after he was found guilty at the court session held at the Maimalari Cantonment, Maiduguri.  This, according to the court, is in accordance with Section 106 of the Armed Forces Act. Maduabuchi had in July 2020 fired at least five shots at the late Ngorgi, while the latter was on the telephone with his newly married wife. He was said to have embarked on the shooting spree shortly after the troops returned from scanning the environment to wade off Boko Haram terrorists. SaharaReporters gathered that the shooter aimed at the officer’s chest and released rapid rounds, stunning his colleagues who were present.

5 Months Ago “We were all shocked because we did not expect that such a thing could happen at that moment. Soldiers and officers were in a sad mood to the extent that they wanted to go and kill the shooter in the guardroom but the Brigade Commander ordered that they should not kill the guy. “Later, we tried to verify if there were issues between them but nothing personal was established. We only found out that the soldier’s bank account had been blocked for several months so he could not collect his office allowance and salary. He had been complaining that he was also not even given a pass so he could go out. We are in a sad mood already here,” a source said.
