"The PTF wishes to appeal strongly to all Nigerians to take responsibility and stay very safe. In this regard, I also want to remind all parents, grandparents, everyone with underlying factors, and particularly school proprietors that all precautionary measures must be taken at home and in the schools when managing the pupils and students.
