No fewer than 200 houses in the Labiran area of Ibadan, the Oyo state capital, were razed in a midnight attack on Friday. SaharaReporters learnt that many residents have fled the area following the attack. Illustration An eyewitness told SaharaReporters that the attack, which started around 11pm on Thursday night, lasted for over three hours. Affected prominent family houses are Mogaji Akinsola's house, Oniroko Family house, Afunlayin Family house, Aderogba and Beyeruka family house. The family head of Akinsola house, Mogaji Wale Oladoja, who confirmed the incident to SaharaReporters on the phone, threatened to avenge the attack on his family house if the government refused to act on time. He said over 250 hoodlums invaded the area around 11pm on Thursday and set ablaze all the family properties in the area. Oladoja said; "Those guys arrived in the area around 11pm. They burnt about 200 houses and destroyed 29 vehicles. I know it has a political undertone but let me warn the perpetrator that I won't take it easy with them. Why my family house?" he queried.
