The Public Relations Officer of the Edo State Command of the Nigerian Immigration Service, Bridget Esene, who was kidnapped on Sunday, has been released. SaharaReporters had reported how gunmen trailed Esene while she was going to church around the Ikhueniro area, off Agbor Road, Edo state, accosted her and dragged her out of her car. They were said to have put her in their own car and thereafter drove off to an unknown destination while her car was recovered where it was left at Agbor Road. But on Tuesday, the Spokesperson for the Edo State Police Command, Chidi Nwabuzor, stated that Esene had been released. Nwabuzor declined to say if ransom was paid for her release, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported. However, according to reports, a family source claimed that ransom was paid to secure her release but the amount paid was not disclosed. It was also gathered that Esene was sold by the kidnappers to another gang suspected to be herdsmen. She said, â€œI was forced into the car and driven out of the church premises by the five gunmen who later sold me to another set of kidnappers who are suspected herdsmen. The armed men later took me into the forest and some other hardened kidnappers were on the ground to receive me. I was later sold to another set of gunmen who then took me deeper into the forest."
