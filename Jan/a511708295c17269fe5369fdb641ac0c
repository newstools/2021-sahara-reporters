It has been confirmed that Donald Trump left a letter for President-elect Joe Biden before departing the White House. Trump had left the White House in company with his wife, Melania.  The helicopter which conveyed the President took him around the premises of the White House to give him a final view before arriving at Joint Base Andrews. However, despite breaking one of the traditions of transfer of power between presidents - skipping Biden’s inauguration - Trump left a note which the White house spokesperson Judd Deere described as a personal note.

12 Hours Ago In a CNN report, Deere had confirmed that Trump left the letter for Biden in the Oval Office's Resolute Desk. The content of the letter is undisclosed as Presidents usually leave a note of congratulations and support behind in the Oval Office. "It’s a letter between 45 and 46," Deere said. In 2017, Trump received a letter from President Barack Obama wishing him and his administration good fortune and urging him to ensure that the “instruments of our democracy are at least as strong as we found them.” “We are just temporary occupants of this office,” President Barack Obama wrote. “That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions – like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties – that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it’s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.”
