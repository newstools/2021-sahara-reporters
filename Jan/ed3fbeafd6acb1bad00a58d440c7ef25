The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has sacked an unmarried female corporal identified as Olajide Omolola for getting pregnant in Ekiti. According to The PUNCH, the NPF announced her dismissal in a wireless message with reference number CJ:4161/EKS/IY/Vol.2/236, DTO:181330/01/2021 that originated from the Department of Finance and Administration in Ado Ekiti.  The document was addressed to the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) at Iye Ekiti where Omolola is based. In the message, the Chief Financial Officer in Ekiti was asked to relay the information of her dismissal to the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS) to ensure that her salary was stopped. The statement read, “Section 127 of the Police Act and Regulation against women police getting pregnant before marriage W/PC (woman corporal) Olajide Omolola passed out of Police Training School on 24/04/2020 attached to yours contravened above provisions. “She stands dismissed from the force. Dekit her. Retrieve police documents in her possession with immediate effect. O/C CFO Ekiti only. You are to relay signal to IPPIS Abuja for the stoppage of her salary with immediate effect. “DECOMPOLS (deputy commissioners of police)/ACPOLS (assistant commissioners of police)/HODs/DPOs Ekiti State only. You are to lecture women police. Treat as very urgent.” Omolola completed police training on April 24, 2020, and was attached to Iye Ekiti. However, investigation showed that the aspect of the Police Act which was being relied on to justify the sacking of the policewoman had been repealed in the amended Police Act that was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari in September 2020. ‌Part of the old law which has been repealed also made it compulsory for policewomen to seek the permission of their superiors before getting married.
