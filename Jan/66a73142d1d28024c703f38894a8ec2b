One person has been reportedly shot dead during a clash between anti-riot policemen and protesting members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, popularly known as Shiites in Abuja. The protest kicked off at the National Human Rights Commission junction in the Maitama area of Abuja, with members of the group chanting anti-government songs to demand the release of their leader, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, and his wife, Zeenat, from the Kaduna Correctional Centre.  A detachment of armed policemen upon sighting the crowd near Transcorp Hilton junction fired teargas canisters and live bullets to disperse them. One of the protesters was said to have been shot in the stomach while some others sustained injuries.  The Secretary of Academic Forum of the Movement, Abdullahi Musa, also confirmed the death of the member as a result of the gunshot injuries he sustained in his stomach. The situation caused pandemonium in the area as motorists and passersby ran in different directions to avoid being caught in the melee.  One person was also shot in the hand on Monday when the police swooped on the sect at the Federal Secretariat, Abuja, during a similar procession.
