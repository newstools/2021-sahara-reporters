We have detained him for investigations. “In such cases, the agencies resort to feeding bananas to the empty stomach of the suspects. Such concealment of drugs in the body is an old method which is usually used by smugglers while flying through airports. “However, such concealment can be life threatening. In 2013, the customs arrested two Tanzanian nationals at the airport with cocaine capsules weighing 1kg each in their stomach. One of them died after a capsule burst in his stomach.”
