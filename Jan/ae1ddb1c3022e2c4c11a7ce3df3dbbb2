A housewife identified as Suwaiba Shuaibu has allegedly killed her husband’s fiancée, 17-year-old Aisha Kabir, in Gimawa village, Doguwa Local Government Area of Kano State a few days prior to their wedding. According to Vanguard, the husband, Shahrehu Alhaji Ali, and his fiancée, Aisha, were said to have been in a serious relationship for over six years and scheduled to tie the knot on 9th January, 2021 before the ugly incident happened.  It was gathered that the housewife, Suwaiba (second wife), got wind of the planned wedding ceremony and lured the proposed new bride (the late Aisha) to an uncompleted building in the neighbourhood where she stabbed her to death.
