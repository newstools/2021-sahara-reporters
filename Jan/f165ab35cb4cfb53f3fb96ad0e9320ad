Aisha Yakubu, whose building was allegedly billed to host the botched Kaduna sex party, has alleged that she was targeted because her husband is the spokesman for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. In her phone conversation with Reno Omokri, Special Assistant to former Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan, Yakubu made the allegation, stating that the state government was aware of her relationship with the PDP spokesperson.  When asked if the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-rufai, was aware of the relationship, she said, "Yes, Sam Aruwan is aware of it, all of them." She also debunked claims that the building was demolished because it had no valid title or development permit. "That's not correct sir. it's a lie." She also said she was not able to recover any item from the building, noting that "they destroyed everything."
