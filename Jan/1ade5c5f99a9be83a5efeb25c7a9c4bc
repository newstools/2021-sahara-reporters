An employee of The Polytechnic, Ibadan, Oyo State, Kola Oladunjoye, was reportedly killed in an accident on Thursday. Though it was not clear how many people were killed in the car, SaharaReporters learnt that others in the car were not staff members of the polytechnic.  SaharaReporters gathered that they were returning to Ibadan from Oke-Ogun Polytechnic when they had an accident. The incident occurred at a lagoon near Moniya community in Ibadan, the state capital, the source said. "I heard they were almost in Ibadan when they had the accident. It is a very sad day for The Polytechnic, Ibadan and its staff. The man was the immediate former head of the department of Architecture. He was a very vibrant and committed individual. It is very painful," the source said.
