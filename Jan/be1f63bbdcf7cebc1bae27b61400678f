The state government had stated that it demolished the building for hosting a nude party but later made a U-turn, saying that the main reason for the demolition was that the building had no approval.The party's organisers had told the press that the proposed nude party never held and it was just a prank to attract attendees.The restaurant owner had also accused the police of extorting N120,000 from her and caused her to lose her pregnancy.On Wednesday, however, the state government arraigned those operating the restaurant, the staff working there and the customers who organised the party.
