Following the Capitol coup, the North American country's Department of Homeland Security has hired a private security firm for $1.6m ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration as the 46th President of the United States, TMZ reports. Documents obtained by the newspaper revealed that the department awarded a private security company called Hana Industries Inc. a $1.6 million contract for protective services, effective now until the very end of the month. AFP/Getty Images It was learnt that Hana's protective security officers will be standing watch in the capital and surrounding areas. The move to hire a private security came directly on the heels of the failed Capitol coup and the contract was awarded two days after last week's siege. Hana, which has protected Naval bases and shipyards around Hawaii prior to the new contract, has been recruiting to get more boots on the ground, especially people with two to five years of military or law enforcement experience and prior certification from the Department of Homeland Security. The need for private security to support the National Guard and police forces in Washington, came up after the FBI warned that domestic terrorists were planning to take action in Washington, D.C. and all 50 states between January 16 through Inauguration Day.
