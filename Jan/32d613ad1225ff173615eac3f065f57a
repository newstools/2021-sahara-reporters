2 Days Ago In the video that lasted for nine minutes and 56 seconds, Shekau said he heard about the retirement of the previous service chiefs and their replacement with new ones, saying his message was to call them to Islam. The Jama’atu Ahlussunnah Lidda’awati Wal Jihad leader also mentioned the names and roles of the new service chiefs and called them to repent, saying they can’t do anything to destroy his terror gang. He said, “Leo Irabor, the head of the military, you should have sympathy for yourself, repent and convert to Islam. There is nothing you can do.” Shekau said Attahiru should not deceive himself because he has a Muslim background. “Even if you are Muslim but you conduct polytheistic practices, you are no longer a Muslim,” he said.
