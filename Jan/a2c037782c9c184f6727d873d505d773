According to Obiakwa, Odume is a very peaceful woman who is not violent. He said when she is angry, she keeps quiet. He said, "We started dating two years ago. Though I live far away and you know how long-distance relationships can be. I came back last October for a traditional wedding which I invited her to attend with me and she came. We never broke up just that the relationship is no longer how it is supposed to be. "Since I have known her, she has never been a violent person. Whenever she is angry, all she does is to keep quiet. I don't think she can kill someone except she says it herself."
