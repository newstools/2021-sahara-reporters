The Guardian Nigeria A resident, who spoke with Saharareporters in Ibadan on Saturday, said many residents had fled the area for fear of being caught up in the fracas. "We are tired in this area," he said. "I cannot go home again. I sleep at my friend's house with my family. This is where I slept last night, and I am fed up. The clash was a usual incident in our area. "It seems we don't have a government in Oyo State again," he continued. "I went home this morning, and the remains of the last victim are still there. A neighbour just called me now that they are just taking the corpse away now. I don't know the kind of country we are in."
