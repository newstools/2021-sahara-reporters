The trial of human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, was stalled on Monday at a Federal High Court in Abuja following the death of a judge in the Abeokuta division of the court. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu had on December 11, 2020, adjourned the case to January 25, February 4 and 5 for the continuation of trial.  Upon the arrival of the activist and his lawyers in the court, the case, which had been scheduled to commence by 1pm, could not go on as they were informed by the court registrar that the judge would not be sitting as a result of the death of her colleague in the Abeokuta division of the court. Meanwhile, the activist described the development as part of delay tactics employed by the Nigerian government to keep him distracted, adding that such a plan would not work. He urged his supporters not to give up in their demand for good governance until the country was completely liberated from the shackles of bad leadership. A prosecution witness, an operative of the Department of State Services, Rasheed Olawale, who was brought to court at the last adjournment date to testify against Sowore, however, claimed that he was in secondary school when he heard that President Muhammadu Buhari overthrew a democratically elected government of late Alhaji Shehu Shagari in 1983 â€“ the only revolution he knew about. He also told the court that there was no record of a revolution in any part of the country on August 5, 2019, something the human rights activist was accused of instigating and subsequently arrested for. Sowore was arrested in Lagos on August 3, 2019 for calling on Nigerians to take to the streets in peaceful demonstrations to demand a better country from the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
