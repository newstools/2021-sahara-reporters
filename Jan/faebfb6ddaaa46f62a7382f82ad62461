Global human rights’ body, Amnesty International, has called on the Nigerian government to “immediately and unconditionally release” human rights’ activist, Omoyele Sowore, and other activists who were arrested by the police during a New Year’s Eve peaceful protest in Abuja. AI noted that the arrest solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly is a flagrant violation of the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended] and the country’s international human rights obligations, including under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Injured Sowore in custody of the Nigeria Police Amnesty in a statement on Saturday stated that Sowore’s continued detention is a matter of concern for Nigeria. See Also

2 Days Ago “His case shows just how far Nigerian authorities can go to silence peaceful dissent. The government of President Muhammadu Buhari must stop targeting activists and respect the human rights of everyone. “Amnesty International is also calling on the authorities to carry out a prompt, thorough, and effective investigation into allegations of torture and other ill-treatment during the period leading to the arrest of Sowore and other activists, and for anyone suspected to be responsible to be brought to justice in fair trials. “Omoyele Sowore is an Amnesty International’s Prisoner of Conscience who is currently facing unfair trials on the basis of bogus and politically motivated charges,” the body stated.
