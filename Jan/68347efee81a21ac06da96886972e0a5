On Sunday, the Ekiti Government said it would not leave anything to chance in 2021 on the growing concerns about insecurity in the state, particularly kidnapping. Therefore, it voted N1.4billion for the State Security Network, codenamed Amotekun Corps, in its 2021 budget.  The Commissioner for Budget, Mr Femi Ajayi, made this known at a briefing in Ado Ekiti. He gave the detailed analysis of the N109.666 billion budget passed by the state legislative and recently assented to by Gov. Kayode Fayemi. The News Agency of Nigeria recalled that Fayemi had on December 23, 2020, assented to the budgetary provision, christened "Budget of Recovery and Economic Restoration", comprising N58. 4 billion for recurrent and N51.6 billion for capital expenditures. Ajayi said that the priority to security was to attract investment further and ensure the safety of all investors and residents. Following the ongoing security challenges that include kidnapping, herders/farmers clashes, robberies in the country, and ensuring the security of lives and properties, Governor Kayode Fayemi inaugurated the Ekiti State Security Trust Fund coined 'Amotekun' in collaboration with the other South-Western States on October 19 2020. "A sum of N1.44 billion has been earmarked as capital allocation for the Amotekun Corps. For the procurement of drones for surveillance, a sum of N550 million has been earmarked while a total of N320 million will be spent on safety city projects and the Ekiti State Security Trust Fund will gulp a sum of N55 million," the commissioner said.
