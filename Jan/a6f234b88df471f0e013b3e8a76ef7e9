US Vice-president Kamala Harris has just made history, becoming the first female Black and first South Asian vice president in the nation's history. Her husband, Doug Emhoff, has also made history, becoming America's first second gentleman.  Emoff will use the official @SecondGentleman account starting today. Earlier this week, he tweeted about his new role: "I have a growing sense of responsibility. But I know we wouldn't be here without the support of so many — family, friends, and beyond. Thank you for being in our corner as we take on this next chapter." Emhoff, a successful entertainment lawyer, married Harris in 2014 when she was serving as the attorney general of California. Harris is the stepmother to Emhoff’s two adult children, Cole and Ella, CNN reports. Emoff’s support of Harris throughout her career has been notable, especially during Harris’ run for president. And while Emoff has stayed out of the spotlight for the most part, he said, "I might be the first Second Gentleman, but I don't want to be the last." See Also
