The leadership of the National Union of Zamfara State Students, NUZAMSS, has criticised the state governor, Bello Matawalle, over his failure to provide scholarship funds for indigent students. Matawalle had during his campaign promised to give scholarships to students before his 100 days in office.  But according to the students, he has broken the promise. On Wednesday, the students stormed the state government house to register their anger with various placards while calling on the governor to implement the promises he made to students as regards scholarship funds.  The students also said they had been trying to meet with the governor but all their efforts were unsuccessful. Commenting on the development, a final-year student of engineering in Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State, who is from Zamfara State, said he had to defer an academic session because of Matawalle's failure to fund the scholarship board.  He told SaharaReporters that he set up a small business to support himself but the business was not thriving, and that he had already paid N15, 000 as a deferment fee. SaharaReporters earlier reported how Zamfara State government gave 15 brand new Hilux vehicles to leaders of different repentant bandits in the state. It was also reported that the governor approved millions of naira to be given to the 'repentant' bandits as compensation.
