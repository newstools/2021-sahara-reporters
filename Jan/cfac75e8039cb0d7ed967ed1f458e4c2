A Kaduna State High Court, on Monday, ordered the Nigerian Correctional Service to evacuate the wife of the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Zeenat, to an isolation centre, for COVID-19 treatment. This followed a medical test result tendered at the resumed sitting on Monday by her counsel, Femi Falana (SAN), which showed that Zeenat had tested positive for coronavirus. Zakzaky and wife Zeenat Falana told the court that the medical facility at the Kaduna correctional centre lacked the things needed to treat the virus. Delivering a ruling, Justice Gideon Kurada specifically ordered that she should be moved to a government-approved isolation and treatment centre. Last Thursday, Mohammed, son of the IMN leader, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, said his mother, Zeenat, tested positive for COVID-19 at the Kaduna Correctional Centre, but that the authorities refused to release her for treatment.
