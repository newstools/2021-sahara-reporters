The chairman, Ibadan Depot, Alhaji Bukola Mutiu, in a statement issued in Ibarapa, said the closure of all filling stations in Ibarapa was a warning to the Oyo State government to urgently arrest the growing trend of killing and kidnapping of petroleum dealers in the state. Describing the killing of Mrs Serifat Adisa as one too many, IPMAN warned that except the trend was curbed, all filling stations in the state would be shut down. Mutiu said: “Killing and kidnapping have become so rampant as a series of cases have been coming up recently. "On Saturday, one of us, Alhaja Sherifat Adisa, who was the owner of Subawah Petroleum, was kidnapped around 7:30 pm at her office and two people were killed in her station. Her corpse was found around 11:00 pm, close to her station. “However, the IPMAN has decided to close down all petrol stations in Ibarapa till something is done by the government to protect them and if something is not done, the shutdown of all petrol stations will be extended to Oyo State as a whole.”
