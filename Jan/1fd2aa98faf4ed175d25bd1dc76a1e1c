A chief in Ibadan, Oyo State, Mogaji Wale Oladoja, has said the recent arrest of the Convener of #RevolutionNow, Omoyele Sowore, by the Nigerian government shows that President Muhammadu Buhari has not changed as a former military dictator. He advised the Nigerian government to release Sowore and others arrested by its agencies so as not to incur the full wrath of the youth.  Oladoja in a statement in Ibadan, Oyo State on Monday, said Buhari and other government officials should consider their future in Nigeria in whatever decision they take. The Ibadan-born chief said it was still unclear to him why Buhari had been treating Nigerians like aliens, adding that nobody was arrested or harassed him when he led a protest in Kaduna in 2012. He said, "We all know the role Buhari played in demarketing former President Goodluck Jonathan by going from one place to the other protesting. Today, he cannot tolerate Nigerians again. It is their right to protest against bad governance, insecurity, nepotism and even unreasonable policies of government. "It is time for Buhari and his cabinet to retrace their steps and ensure that Nigerians are not treated as second-class citizens in their own country. Buhari should release Sowore and all others who were kidnapped, in the next few hours before the Yoruba nation rises against his government. "We have had enough of his dictatorship in Nigeria. The likes of Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, Col. Sambo Dasuki (retd.), Olisa Metuh and many more are victims of Buhari's inhumane treatment. It is time for Buhari to change his ways of doing things and embrace democratic leadership before it is too late."
