THISDAY Ojukwu held that Yari had not shown good cause why the order sought by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission should not be granted. The ICPC had instituted the suit seeking an order compelling Yari to show why the funds under investigation should not be finally forfeited to the federal government. The suit brought by ICPC counsel, Osuobeni Akponimisingha had two companies; Kayatawa Nigeria Ltd and B. T. Oil and Gas Nigeria Ltd as respondents, Daily Trust reports. The ICPC had in 2019 filed an ex parte motion before Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the same court seeking an interim forfeiture order, alleging that the funds were proceeds of unlawful activity, which was granted by the court.
