The Shehu of Dikwa, Borno State, Alhaji Mohammed Ibn Shehu Masta II El-Kanemi, is dead. SaharaReporters gathered that the monarch died in the early hours of Saturday at a private hospital in Abuja after suffering from an undisclosed ailment.  The late monarchâ€™s funeral prayers are expected to hold at Shehu Palace in Maiduguri on Saturday. This is the third in the series of high-profile deaths in Borno State within short intervals, after those of Shehu of Bama and Emir of Biu in 2020. Former Governor Ali Modu Sheriff appointed the late El-Kanemi in 2010 as Shehu of the newly created Dikwa Emirate. That appointment split the 100 years old Dikwa Emirate into two: Bama and Dikwa Emirates. The old Dikwa Emirate was made up of four local government areas: Bama, Ngala, Dikwa and Kala- Balge with 24 districts with the palace in Bama town. The new Dikwa Emirate now has three local government areas: Ngala, Dikwa and Kala-Balge with 12 districts while Bama Emirate now has one local government area with 12 districts.
