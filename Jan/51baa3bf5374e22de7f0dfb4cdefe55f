A community source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "As I speak with you, many people are still hiding in the bush and many houses have been burnt down. "The gunmen came in over 50 speedboats, shooting sporadically. When they gained entrance into the community, people had no other option but to run into the bush for safety. "Our intelligence report says that the gunmen have vowed to remain in the community and ensure that Ogunbos and his followers never return to the community. "I was told that the Christmas Day attack on Ogunbos' house was planned to drive him out of the town, and that today's attack was aimed at taking total control of the community." The state police command has yet to confirm the attack or any loss of life.
