The 78-year-old cleric, who donned a face shield, advised members of his church not to be afraid of the virus but implored them to obey all health guidelines. He said, “I want you to relax but don’t be careless. When I say relax, I do not say be careless. I hope you know the difference between the two. When they say wear your mask, wear your mask. When they say wash your hands, wash your hands. You know we are very particular about hygiene. Even when corona (coronavirus) is gone, keep on washing your hands.” A viral photo of the cleric wearing a face shield while laying hands on a bedridden person had attracted public criticism last week but speaking on Sunday, the cleric said the need for social distancing would not prevent him from laying hands on the sick. “When they talk about social distancing, do that as much as possible. Obey the government. “But I can’t distance myself from my wife and I am not going to allow social distancing prevent me from laying hands on the sick so that they can recover – that is my duty and I will do it,” Adeboye said, stressing that he washed his hands frequently.
