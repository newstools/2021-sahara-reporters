The Chief Executive Officer of Asher Kings and Queens Restaurant in Kaduna State, Aisha Yakubu, has said she was not the owner of the facility demolished by the Kaduna State government over alleged plans to host a sex party. According to PUNCH, Yakubu said she rented the building for her business at the rate of N500,000 per annum.  “I have a landlord. I am not the owner of the building. I was the first occupant of the plot. It was just me on the plot and I paid N500,000 for the rent,” she said. “The landlord was not informed before the demolition occurred. He called me during the demolition and asked if there was any notice and I told him there was none. “He (the landlord) knows me and he knows I can’t do something of such nature.” See Also

The restauranteur, who said life had not been the same since the demolition occurred, insisted that the facility was not a hotel as claimed by the police and the state government.
