Salami Oladapo, media aide to Yoruba Freedom fighter, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, has said that they know the identities of the people who burnt Igboho's house on Tuesday. SaharaReporters had earlier reported that one of the houses of Sunday Igboho was set ablaze in Ibadan, Oyo State. Speaking with SaharaReporters on the phone, Oladapo said: "We know the perpetrators but we won’t disclose yet. If they were strong enough, they should have come to his new house but they dare not. We are looking at the trend of things before we say anything.  "No one was injured. We are not going to do anything, we leave it to God. No cause for alarm, we are calm now so we can adequately plan our next move." Earlier on Tuesday, after the arson attack on his house, Igboho said he was not in a hurry to blame any individual or group for it. See Also

11 Hours Ago Igboho said he would allow the authorities to investigate the incident. “I cannot blame anyone right now for the attack, not even Fulani people,” he said by telephone hours after the attack. “We have to thank God that nobody was killed, it is more important.” He said he moved out of the property about a year ago to a new property also in Soka, the same area in Ibadan, Oyo State.

7 Hours Ago Igboho had given a seven-day ultimatum to Fulani herdsmen to leave the Ibarapa area of Oyo State, blaming them for the insecurity there. Last week, shortly after Igboho's visit to Igangan community in the state, the house and cars of the Seriki Fulani of Igangan, Alhaji Saliu Abdulkadir, were burnt by some youths. Abdulkadir later said he and his family had to trek from Oyo State to Ogun State, taking bush paths. Since the Seriki Fulani's belongings were gutted in the arson attack, some persons and groups, particularly from the North, have been calling for the arrest of Igboho, blaming him for the attack on the Fulani leader.
