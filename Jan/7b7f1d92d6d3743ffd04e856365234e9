Speaking to SaharaReporters, Austin said he couldn’t deal with the news, considering the enormous additional responsibilities the birth of the new babies would put on him. He said he had no other option but to take to his heels. “Yes, that’s the truth my brother, I ran away, you know as the whole Nigeria be, no money, nothing. I was once an engineer but now a farmer. I don’t have any money. “I appeal to the government and well-meaning Nigerians to help us. I wasn’t aware she would give birth to quadruplets; we didn’t do any scan. I really need government support for medical care and many other things.” A Facebook user, Sarah Az Izevbigie, had posted the story about how Austin ran away from home following the birth of the quadruplets.
