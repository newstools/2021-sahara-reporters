The Ogun State Police Command invited the Ogun State Commissioner for Environment, Abiodun Abdul-Balogun, for allegedly sexually harassing a 16-year-old lady, Barakat, at Ita Otu, Ogun Waterside Local Government Area of the state on Friday for questioning. The command, through the Abigi Police Station, sent an invitation to the commissioner to come and answer questions regarding the allegations against him.  In the police invite sent to Abdul-Balogun, dated January 1, 2021, and signed by the Divisional Police Officer, the commissioner was to appear before 1pm on the same day. The teenager had recounted that the sexual harassment occurred on Thursday, December 31, in the commissioner’s apartment, where he allegedly fondled her breasts and ranted incantations, while she screamed and struggled to free herself from his grip. The victim, in her confession statement to the police at the Abigi Division, had narrated that the commissioner’s aides lured her to his house and his bedroom, after which the commissioner came in and bolted the door.
