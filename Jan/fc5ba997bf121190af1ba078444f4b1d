As a union, we are calling on security agencies to take control of the situation and ensure the successful rescue of our colleague. “The abductors are also advised to release him unconditionally without further delay. The union will not accept any abduction of any of our members, even after Finwe is released. If after a while, he is not released, we are going to embark on a serious peaceful protest.”
