Four hundred and twenty-four Nigerians who were stranded in a Saudi Arabia have arrived in their home country. The Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa, disclosed this in a post on her Twitter page on Friday.  She, however, enjoined Nigerians to desist from embarking on illegal migration. The tweet read, “424 more Nigerians stranded in Saudi have arrived (in) Abuja. They will proceed on the mandatory 14 days quarantine. We appeal to Nigerians to desist from illegal migration.” The returnees will join the 384 returnees that arrived yesterday and are currently undergoing quarantine at the Federal Capital Territory Hajj camp for 14 days in line with the reversed COVID-19 protocols by the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19. @NigeriaGov @DigiCommsNG pic.twitter.com/NdBiCyApDp  NIDCOM had on Thursday said a total of 384 out of 802 Nigerians stranded in Saudi Arabia arrived at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.
