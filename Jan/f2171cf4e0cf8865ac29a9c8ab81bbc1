The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Kukah, has said Nigeria is now a wasteland where people commit sins to seek forgiveness abroad. In his sermon titled “A Nation in Search of Its Soul” at the wake for Archbishop Peter Yariyock Jatau at St. Joseph’s Catholic Cathedral, Kaduna, Kukah condemned the state of affairs in the country.  He said, "Nigeria has become a 'huge waste land, huge debris of the deceit, lies, treachery, double dealing and duplicity.'" According to him, Nigerians sin at home by stealing the nation’s resources but seek repentance and forgiveness in Saudi Arabia and Jerusalem, Israel in the guise of lesser or higher pilgrimages. Kukah said, “Today, our dear nation is like the proverbial farmer searching for his black goat. He has to do it with a sense of urgency because darkness is setting in as the sun quickly recedes. “Our nation has become one huge waste land, huge debris of the deceit, lies, treachery, double dealing and duplicity. Nigerian politicians have turned our politics into a huge trojan horse, a hoax, a hall of guile and dissimulation. “The levels of frustration are rising by the day and we can see all this in the rise in domestic violence and inter-communal conflicts. A combination of all these has turned us unto a nation at war with itself. “Nigerians complain that the country is full of churches and mosques and they cannot find the values of these religions in everyday life. We sin at home by stealing the nation’s resources but we seek repentance and forgiveness in Saudi Arabia and Jerusalem in the guise of lesser or higher pilgrimages."
