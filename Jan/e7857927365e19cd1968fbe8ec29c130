10 Hours Ago The magistrate ordered the remand of Sowore and four others at the Kuje Correctional Centre. Their formal bail application will be heard on Tuesday, January 5, 2020. Sowore was arrested by the police for leading a protest against bad governance on New Year’s Eve in Abuja. The FCT police prepared the charges against the activists, despite calls from global and national rights groups condemning the police brutality, arrest and detention. In court, the case was between the activists and the FCT Commissioner of Police. The magistrate ruled that all charges were bailable and that it was a fundamental right except if the defendant was likely to evade trial or commit the same offence. She stated that the bail application should be brought before her within the next 24 hours. The magistrate had earlier suggested Wuse Police Station, but when she tried to reach the Wuse Divisional Police Officer, their phone line was not reachable. She then asked the activists to be remanded at the Kuje Correctional facility, pending the hearing of their bail application.
