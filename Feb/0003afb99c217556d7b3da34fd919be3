1.The days of Brutalizing Innocent citizens, The era of Strangulating Dissenting throats, The junta of Bullets and blood We thought died After Abacha swallowed That apple, But we were Wrong  2. The atmosphere of fear Of the forces That be Gliding between rooms In Aso Rock And their minions In State Houses, Fear of being ‘wasted’ For embracing Human Rights And then actually being wasted Like M.K.O.  Abiola Kudirat Abiola Dele Giwa And everyone Recently murdered At Lekki With nobody Held to account, These fears We thought got Buried As Abacha’s body Was swallowed By earth But we were Wrong  3. Abacha is Alive Reincarnated In ‘Agbada’ And a well pressed suit, At his order Innocent Nigerians were Murdered At Lekki And other cities By bullets Purchased With their taxes, And though he Quickly erected a Deceitful Judicial panel No justice will be served As he is the Accused  4. Abacha is Alive Resurrected and Now more intolerant Of peaceful protests, He is the constituted Authority And with the heels Of his boots He will crush anyone Brave enough ‘To look his Uche In the eyes,’ Fire for fire He will kill Harmless citizens Holding flags Singing the Nigerian Anthem, He is at Alausa, He is in the Villa Aso, He never died The real Abacha Is Alive  By Ayomikun Soyombo @alabaster85
