Speaking in confidence with our correspondent, a close political associate of the late lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed displeasure over the development, describing it as "greed and wickedness", adding that "so many secret meetings are held every day by some greedy and wicked Isoko North party leaders and those jostling for his position"."We shall all die one day. This is a man who died and barely 24 hours later, while his corpse was still lying in the mortuary, some people had started jostling for his position, holding meetings here and there. We know where his death came from, not this COVID-19 of a thing they are struggling to make us believe. We all know his death came from the recent struggle over who would produce the chairman of Isoko North Local Government Area in the March 6, 2021 council polls and the 2023 politics."Even all those who never wished him well in life are those pouring deceptive tributes and condolence messages, describing him as a friend and brother when in real sense of it, they never wished him well. These satanic minds and green snakes in free grass have for long wished Tim Owhefere death before this Wednesday death, all because of 2023 politics and the diabolical and bitter politics being played in Isoko nation, especially Isoko North."A professional colleague and political associate of the later lawmaker, Irogbo Afor, a lawyer, suggested that the death of Owhefere was not ordinary but political and diabolical, even as he described him as a "godsend brother and rare gem with the largest human heart".
