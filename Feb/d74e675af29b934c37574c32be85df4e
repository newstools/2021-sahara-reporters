The Eti-Osa Bar Forum is set to sue the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry into Compensation and Restitution for Victims of SARS-related Abuses and Other Related Matters for granting Lekki Concession Company approval to resume business at the toll gate, where #EndSARS protesters were killed last October. The panel's February 6, 2021 order granted to LCC an order of repossession and for insurance claims, repairs and renovations, and resumption of business. Lagos Judicial Panel
SaharaReporters Media The plan to sue the panel was made known in a statement issued by Yakubu Eleto, the Publicity Secretary of the Forum. On the upcoming #OccupyLekkiTollGates Protests, the Forum is of the view that both Anti-Lekki Toll Gates Protesters and #DefendLagos Protesters have fundamental rights to freedom of assembly. The Forum said instead of the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, threatening protesters with security agencies, "the protesters should be protected by security agencies during their protests to avoid breakdown of law and order". The Forum also appealed to the Attorney General of Lagos State, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), to advise the state government against the reopening of the Lekki toll gate for full business, saying the panel lacks the jurisdiction to have delivered the judgement. According to the Forum, the government should engage in constructive dialogue with all stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues bordering on injustices committed on October 20, 2020, now known as Lekki Massacre. It said a repeat of such would not be tenable on February 13, 2021, when the OccupyLekkiTollGates protest is set to be held at the Lekki toll gate. The Forum noted that while it is not part of the organisers of the current #OccupyLekkiTollGates protests, "it pioneered the #OccupyLekkiTollGates protests on February 7, 2018, when the Lekki Concession Company increased toll fees there". The Forum, however, condemned every plan of repression against the #OccupyLekkiTollGates protesters, who are set to protest on February 13, 2021. It also called on security agencies not to toe their customary line of harassing and cracking down on peaceful protesters. It noted that it will be running a legal aid clinic and situation room to provide legal representation on behalf of the protesters.
