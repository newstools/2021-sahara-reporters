A Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos has granted a temporary Mareva injunction directing commercial banks to block Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited accounts. The court ruled in a bid to recover the cash value of more than 16 million barrels of crude oil allegedly diverted by the oil giant from AITEO Eastern E & P Company Ltd.  Justice Oluremi Omowunmi Oguntoyinbo gave the order following an ex parte application in suit no FHC/L/CS/52/202 where AITEO Eastern E & P Company Ltd is the plaintiff/applicants and SPDC Ltd is the first defendant. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Shell Western Supply and Trading Ltd, Shell International Trading and Shipping Company Ltd, and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Ltd are second, third, fourth and fifth defendants. The respondents in the suit were 20 banks which Shell companies operate accounts with. AITEO’s application was filed by Messrs Kemi Pinheiro (SAN), leading Dr Mike Ozekhome (SAN), Dapo Olanipekun (SAN), and four other Senior Advocates of Nigeria. Oguntoyinbo in his ruling said the banks should, “ring-fence any cash, bonds, deposits, all forms of negotiable instruments to the value of $2.7 billion and pay all standing credits to the Shell companies up to the value into an interest yielding account in the name of the Chief Registrar of the court.” He also ruled that the Chief Registrar is to “hold the funds in trust” pending the hearing of the motion and determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction filed before it by AITEO.” The order followed an application by AITEO Eastern E & P against SPDC and the other defendants with the 20 lenders as respondents. The court had restrained the defendants or their agents/privies from presenting to the banks "any mandate or instrument for the withdrawal of any money and /or funds standing to the credit of any of the accounts” of the defendants kept/maintained “at any of the named respondent banks… “without first preserving/ring-fencing the sum of $1,251,305.5 or its equivalent in any other official currency including but not limited to the naira and/or pound sterling being the value of the plaintiff’s 1,022,029 barrels of crude oil (at the rate of $79.50 per barrel as stated in the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) letter dated 8th day of July, 2020.” The respondents were further barred from offering any directive or instrument to the named banks for the withdrawal or any money and/or funds standing to the credit of any of the accounts of the five defendants kept or sustained at any of the named respondent banks and/or their branches without first preserving and or ring-fencing the total sum of $2,700,583,779,75 or its equivalent in any other official currency comprising of $799,000,000.00.
