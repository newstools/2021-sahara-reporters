The Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, John Cardinal Onaiyekan But speaking in Minna, the Niger State capital, Onaiyekan said that is not the right thing. "We should not be living in a country where you are always with your heart in your mouth when you are moving from one place to the other," he said in an interview with ChannelsTV. "We should not be living in a country where children cannot study in peace in their schools and where bandits – whatever you call them – from nowhere come and cart away 30, 40 children and their teachers into the bush.

It is about time that we have a government that takes care of the people. This is not political. It has nothing to do with PDP, APC.

The government should either fix it or allow others to do it."
