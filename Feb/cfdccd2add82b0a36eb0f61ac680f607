Boko Haram terrorists have killed five internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Damboa Local Government Area of the Borno State. SaharaReporters gathered that the IDPs were attacked on Sunday inside a forest outside Damboa town while searching for firewood.  “Boko Haram members yesterday slaughtered 5 IDPs in Borno State. The gunmen also went away with some of them,” a military source said. The attack comes a day after the new Chief of Army Staff, Major General Ibrahim Attahiru gave a 48-hour marching order for the clearance of Marte and some communities in Borno State. Attahiru gave the order in Dikwa Local Government Area, the headquarters of the Super Camp 9 Operation Lafiya Dole. “In the last few days, we have had attacks in your Area of Responsibility: it is now high time we get back and fight through and support our forces ahead of you. Areas around Marte, Chukungudu, Krenoa and Kirta Wulgo must be cleared in the next 48 hours,” he had said. “You can rest assured of all the support required in this very onerous task. I have just spoken to your Theatre Commander, General Officer Commanding, you cannot let this nation down. Go there and do the needful and I will be right behind you. Ensure you do your job, and do your job well. “They have presented certain issues that came up, sooner rather than later we would address; where there are no adequate A and B vehicles we would provide with these few remarks. I wish you well on the operation and I know the morale is high.” Boko Haram and its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province, have become more ferocious in recent times. The Nigerian army has repeatedly claimed that the insurgency had been largely defeated and frequently underplays any losses. The terror group has caused over 40,000 deaths and displaced millions of individuals mainly in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states.
