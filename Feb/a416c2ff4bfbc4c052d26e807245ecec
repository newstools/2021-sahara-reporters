1 Day Ago Hisbah officers regularly arrest unmarried people caught in hotels, presumably for sexual activities, as part of their enforcement of the Sharia. They are also notorious for destroying truckloads of alcoholic drinks. Established to enforce Sharia, Hisbah recently banned stylish haircuts, sagging of trousers, playing of music at social events by disk jockeys and seized tricycles from riders for adorning them with pictures considered to be obscene and against the tenents of Islam in some states. Hisbah also banned commercial motorcycle and tricycle riders from carrying two women at a time. This was in addition to other unusual directives reeled out by the Islamic police.
