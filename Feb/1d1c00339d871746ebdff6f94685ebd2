Two children have been confirmed dead, while many persons sustained injuries during a fire outbreak at the Fulatari Internally Displaced Persons' (IDPs) camp in Monguno, Borno State. The fire incident which occurred last Saturday equally destroyed about 100 makeshift shelters at the camp.  SaharaReporters gathered that incident has further compounded the plight of the IDPs. “The IDPs' camp in Monguno was razed on Saturday, unfortunately we have yet to hear anything from NEMA (National Emergency Management Agency) and the Borno State government,” a humanitarian aid worker told SaharaReporters. In 2020, several IDP camps in Nganzai, Ngala, Mafa and Monguno local government areas were gutted by fire as a result of the cluster of settlements there. Those in these camps include women and children who escaped the violence of the Boko Haram insurgency. The terrorists have forced more than two million people to flee their homes since 2009 when Boko Haram began an armed campaign. Some 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict and millions forced to flee their homes. Most of the Displaced persons have been housed in squalid camps where they depend on food handouts from international charities.
