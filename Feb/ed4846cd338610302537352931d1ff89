Three weeks after the face-off between the Fulani residents in Igangan and some Yoruba youths led by Chief Sunday Adeyemo, popularly called Sunday Igboho, the governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, on Sunday visited the troubled Ibarapa land. Dr. Fatai Aborode and other prominent indegenes of Ibarapa land were allegedly killed by Fulani hersmen residing in the area while many were reportedly Kidnapped by herdsmen.  Following the development, a Yoruba activist, Igboho, visited the area and warned against the kidnapping and killing of members of the host community by Fulani herdsmen. Makinde, who visited the area on Sunday, said that he felt the pains of the people of the area and that the visit would enable him to find lasting solutions to the lingering insecurity issues in the area. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, quoted the governor as saying this while addressing council chairpersons and political office holders from Ibarapa Central, Ibarapa East and Ibarapa North, in Igbo Ora, late on Sunday. He stated that the state had approved the setting up of Peace and Security Committee at the local government levels, adding that the state government would put in place other security measures to ensure peace in the area. He also disclosed that the government had directed the immediate take-off of an identity management programme to enable it to know the people in the communities. He said: "The take-home from the interaction for me is that it is a collective problem and I can see the commitment from everybody to find a solution to this. "And, at least, I am quite glad that some of the initiatives that the government is trying to put in place to stem insecurity are coming to fruition. "We will ensure that our identity management programme takes off as quickly as possible. We will also ensure the setting up of peace and security committee that is all-encompassing in the councils." The governor also urged political office holders to always call the attention of the government to the happenings within their localities, saying that he decided to sleep over in Ibarapa to feel the pulse of the people. According to the governor, he cannot sleep with two eyes closed in Ibadan if the people of Ibarapa are unable to sleep with two eyes closed. Last night, I spoke with members of the press after the stakeholdersâ meeting in Igbo-Ora. I confirmed that the additional 200 Amotekun corps members have been deployed to Ibarapa zone, and that we are providing the logistics to enable them function.https://t.co/yYtSUJnTUz pic.twitter.com/bOS6FfONuz  He added that the the problems of insecurity in Ibarapaland must be tackled collectively. The statement added that the governor commiserated with the families that have lost loved ones to the insecurity situation, saying: "So, this is also to let people know that I feel their pain, because I have had a very close interaction with Aborode in the past. I commiserate with his family and many others who have lost loved ones to this situation. “I feel the pain and I believe that with everybody coming together, we will be able to tackle the problem. "Also, political office holders need to know that when they see something, they have to say something." On the enforcement of anti-open grazing law, the governor described it as an area where the state police would have helped. He said: "Quite frankly, the governors are at the mercy of federal security agencies to implement certain laws. "That was why we asked for state police. In the first instance, it is a constitutional issue and, in the absence of having that, governors in the South West came together and formed Amotekun as a stop gap. "Problems don't go away completely. But you have to keep working at it; keep pushing to get to where you really want to be and that is what we will keep doing. "But the law is there, though the implementation has not been smooth, we will keep working at it." On the deployment of additional Amotekun operatives, the governor said: "The 200 Amotekun Corps (members) have been deployed. They are here and we are also supporting them with logistics by bringing four additional operational vehicles for them." The meeting had in attendance the Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly, 'Debo Ogundoyin, commissioners, chairmen and members of boards and parastatals, members of the state House of Assembly and all the political appointees from Ibarapa zone.
