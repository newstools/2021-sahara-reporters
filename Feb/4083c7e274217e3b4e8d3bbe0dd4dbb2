 “I was raped three times. The soldiers shouted on us. They came in the morning and in the evening. We could not easily pick their identities. One of us was beaten to death. She was taken out of the detention and never returned. There were many of us – around 50 girls,” one of the victims said. Another victim said, "I was arrested around the market square while returning from work. I was taken to Obinze barracks and from there the following day, we all found ourselves in Abuja. I was raped also. I secured my freedom through a lawyer only last week. Some of us were tortured as we were being raped."A civic organsiation, International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, from Owerri, Imo State, in a report on the incident, said at least 53 females were raided from Obigbo, and most of them are feared to have been sexually molested by the Nigerian Army personnel.

 “Retired Lt Gen Tukur Yusuf Buratai, as immediate past Chief of Army Staff, chillingly left a legacy of monstrosity and barbarism in the Nigerian Army. It is a height of abomination for soldiers of the Nigerian to have degraded themselves to the extent of engaging in serial rape and other abominable sexual violence against innocent and defenceless women inside the Mogadishu Barracks - a place not far away from the Headquarters of the Nigerian Army in Abuja,” the report said. The group called for an independent government's investigation of the incident, while demanding that Buratai and other culpable serving and retired military officers be brought to justice.
