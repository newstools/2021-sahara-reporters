Three persons, including Mai-Kanuribe of Lagos, Alhaji Mustapha Muhammadu, have died in an accident involving the convoy of Governor Babagana Umara Zulum of Borno State. SaharaReporters gathered that the accident occurred on Tuesday when the governor was heading to Maiduguri after a visit to his hometown in the Mafa Local Government Area, where he went for the membership revalidation exercise of the All Progressives Congress (APC).  Zulum was accompanied by his deputy, Alhaji Umar Usman Kadafur, Senator Kashim Shettima of Borno Central, APC state party chairman, members of the state executive council, council chairmen, traditional rulers, top party members, among others. “Unfortunately, while on their way back after the exercise, the vehicle conveying the Mai-Kanuribe of Lagos, Alhaji Mustapha Muhammadu, somersaulted after a tyre deflated along Mafa/Maiduguri Road, leading to his death and that of two other passengers,” a source told SaharaReporters. The incident comes a few months after Boko Haram terrorists ambushed Zulum’s convoy twice within 48-hour. About 30 people, mostly security agents, who were in his convoy were killed by the insurgents along Cross Kauwa-Baga Road on September 25, 2020. The victims include 12 policemen, five soldiers, four members of a government-backed militia and nine civilians. Less than 48 hours later, the group opened fire on the governor’s convoy along Monguno-Maiduguri Road.
