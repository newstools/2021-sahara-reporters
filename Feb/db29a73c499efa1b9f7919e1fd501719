The Nigeria Labour Congress staged a protest at the Corporate Affairs Commission headquarters in Abuja on Wednesday. The demonstration which began around 8:00 am on the premises of the commission was planned to prevent workers from gaining entry into the building.  According to the union, the demonstration was held over suspected hostile policies against labour workers of the commission. It was learnt that the protest, led by the president of the NLC, Comrade Ayuba Waba, alongside other executives and members of the union, was staged against the decision of the CAC leadership to clamp down on union members who challenged anti-workers policies. However, the Trade Union Congress was not on the same page with the NLC over the protest, which led to a clash between members of both unions. While reacting at the protest ground, Waba alleged that the Commissionâ€™s Registrar General, Garba Abubakar, hindered staff promotion and brought in environmental experts to fumigate the agency for N35 million in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, including contracting someone to paint the Zone 5 annexe office for N25 million. TUC had on Tuesday held a news conference, warning that they would resist protest by the NLC, but the latter stated that it would not renege on its plans to demonstrate against CAC for three days.
