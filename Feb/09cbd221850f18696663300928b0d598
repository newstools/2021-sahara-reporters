A former Commissioner of Environment, Delta State, John Nani, narrowly escaped death on Monday, as his orderly was killed by a mobile policeman. Nani, who is the Executive Director, Finance and Administration of the Delta State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission, escaped death when his orderly tried to interfere in an argument between him and the policeman allegedly attached to Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc in Sapele.  The PUNCH gathered that trouble started when a Toyota Hilux van conveying Seplat staff members hit Nani’s car from behind at Ajogodo around 7 pm.  While the ex-commissioner parked to check the level of damage done to his vehicle, he was reportedly attacked by the mobile policeman. An eyewitness said the deceased officer, who tried to intervene, was shot in the thigh. “The mobile policeman wanted to shoot Nani, but his orderly threw himself there and took the bullet. “He was rushed to hospital, but he couldn’t survive it,” the eyewitness added. The source said the mobile policeman had been arrested. Efforts to reach the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, failed as she did not answer her calls.
