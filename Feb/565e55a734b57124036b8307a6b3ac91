Worried by the insecurity in Edo State, some aggrieved women in Uromi have protested the rising cases of attacks, rituals and kidnapping by suspected Fulani herdsmen. The women, who blocked some major roads in the community, alleged that they were constantly being harassed and intimidated by the herdsmen.  They lamented that they had lost fortunes as a result of the destructive activities of cows belonging to the herdsmen. The protesters noted that they were no longer safe, saying Fulani herdsmen had taken over all the surrounding forests and bushes in the area. They said the solution to the problem is for Fulani herdsmen to leave the area. They added that their crops were always ravaged by cows while some of their kinsmen had been attacked by herdsmen over time, adding that they now lived in constant fear of herdsmen attack.
