The Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to unfreeze the accounts of 20 individuals linked to the #EndSARS protests. The judge, Ahmed Mohammed, issued the order unfreezing the accounts on Wednesday after the legal teams of both the CBN and defendants decided to end the case.  The CBN had in October 2020 asked banks to freeze accounts of 20 #EndSARs protesters. Some of the affected individuals include Bolatito Racheal Oduala, Chima David Ibebunjoh, Mary Doose Kpengwa, Gatefield Nigeria Limited, Saadat Temitope Bibi, Bassey Victor Israel, Wisdom Busaosowo Obi, Nicholas Ikhalea Osazele, Ebere Idibie, Akintomide Lanre Yusuf, Uhuo Ezenwanyi Promise, Mosopefoluwa Odeseye and Adegoke Pamilerin Emmanuel.

3 Months Ago Others are Umoh Grace Ekanem, Babatunde Victor Segun, Mulu Louis Teghenan, Mary Oshifowora, Winifred Akpevweoghene Jacob, Victor Solomon and Idunu A. Williams. Their lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), explained that he vehemently opposed the Nigerian government lawyer, former Attorney General of the Federation, Michael Aondoakaa, who told the court they were still in reconciliation and that the order had expired since last week. The judge, A. R. Mohammed, therefore dismissed the case altogether. The #EndSARS protests, which held for 13 days in various parts of the country, called for the disbanding of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) unit of the police and urged the government to carry out general police reforms. Donations were received in various currencies, including naira and dollars using Flutterwave to provide food, medical care and legal aid to protesters. However, the donation link was disabled. The donation was subsequently moved to Bitcoin.
