He said that the association was well coordinated in all the local government areas in order to carry out it's activities successfully. Idowu added that RTEAN has always been known to be a law-abiding and peaceful organisation and will continue to be so. “We are ready to work with the government in all ways it requires. We know that Governor Seyi Makinde is a listening governor and will acede to our appeal. It is on record that a court in Ibadan a few days ago declared the activities of park managers illegal. “Also, the LGs in Oyo state have been directed to take full charge of the parks. RTEAN is ready to work with the government. He assured Makinde that the government will generate revenue through RTEAN.
