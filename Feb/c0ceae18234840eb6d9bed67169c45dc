A Kano-based young barber from Benue State, Elijah Ode, who was detained by Hisbah corps for allegedly giving his customers haircuts which 'offend' the Islamic faith in the Sabon Gari area of the state, has shared pictures of the alleged offending haircuts via his Twitter page. The barber, who is also a student, was first arrested on January 15, 2021 and rearrested last Wednesday, January 27 after two of his customers were caught with hairstyles deemed blasphemous to the Islamic religion.  Checks by SaharaReporters showed he had taken to his Twitter handle @ode_elijah on January 26, before he was rearrested, to talk about the issue. See Also
