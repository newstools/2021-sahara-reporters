Hisbah, the Sharia law enforcement agency in Jigawa, said it has destroyed no fewer than 3, 000 confiscated bottles of alcohol in the Kazaure Local Government Area of the state. The council commandant, Malam Bello Musa Kazaure, disclosed this on Wednesday.  He said the bottles of alcohol were confiscated from bars in Gada joint at Kazaure town. Kazaure said the move was in line with the commandâ€™s efforts to check immoral act and social vices in the society. He emphasised that consumption of beer was prohibited in all parts of the state, including villages. The council commandant assured that the Hisbah would not relent in its fight against immoral acts, including consumption of alcohol in the state. He advised residents to desist from engaging in vices capable of destroying the society. Despite public condemnation, the destruction of beer and other alcoholic beverages by Hisbah has continued in some northern states. For instance, in November 2020, about 1,975 bottles of beer estimated at N200 million were confiscated and destroyed by the security outfit in Kano State. The agency established to enforce Sharia law in some states recently banned stylish haircuts, sagging of trousers, and playing of music at social events by disk jockeys. They have also been seizing tricycles from riders for adorning them with pictures considered to be obscene and against the tenents of Islam. Hisbah also banned commercial motorcycle and tricycle riders from carrying two women at a time. This was in addition to other unusual directives reeled out by the Islamic police.
