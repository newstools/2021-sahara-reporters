It was learnt that the wheelbarrow pusher hit the cobbler with a charm on Thursday evening but the former died the following morning (Friday), leading to the clash.

A resident of Sasa who spoke with our correspondent, Alhazan Kabiru, on Friday said the police had been able to bring the situation under control. Kabiru said; "I heard the cobbler beside our shop died this morning. I was around Ojoo when the incident happened. I heard It was as a result of an argument between one Hausa guy, who hit a pregnant woman with his wheelbarrow on Thursday. Though I don't really know the Hausa guy, I know his group of friends. The police are here now and they have been able to control the situation but that yesterday night was hell."
