A man identified as Muyiwa Akinbola has alleged that he was physically assaulted by officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Sangotedo, in Lagos State, over a traffic offence he claims he had paid for. According to him, he was stopped by the FRSC officials for using his mobile phone while driving and not using the seat belt.  He, however, said after paying the N4,000 for the said offence as demanded, his car was not released to him. He took to his social media handle to share a video, displaying a bad finger which he claimed was damaged by FRSC officials who took his phone from him. He was heard saying, "Mr. Adekanla, you collected my phone this morning, you seized my car – Ford Explorer. They said I was using my phone while driving, I've gone to the bank to make payment, when I made the payment, I was recording. This is my finger, they injured me here because they were forcing my phone out of my hands. "Mr. Adekanla is here, they have not released the car and I've made payment, he said he would hold my car for one week, I don’t even know the jurisdiction he has to hold my car for one week after making payment. I made the payment at Wema Bank just across the road. Please can @FRSCNigeria tell us what is happening with Mr. Adekanla of FRSC Sango-Tedo?ðð¿Viewer Discretion please. pic.twitter.com/ln3BHSP2da  "The superior officer said he would not release my car because they said I was using my phone, I was on handsfree but regardless, I paid the N4, 000 but they still refused to release my car. They even said I didn't use my seatbelt when I did. They collected my phone. This is how FRSC, Sangotedo faulted (sic) my finger on top of N4,000 that I have paid, this is abuse of power." In reaction, the FRSC said Akinbola did not only violate established road traffic regulations but also had in his possession, a number plate that belonged to another vehicle. A statement issued by the Assistant Corps Marshal Corps, Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, read, "The attention of the Federal Road Safety Corps has been drawn to a trending video recently being circulated online, showing one Muyiwa Akinbola, air traffic offender, who claimed his finger was damaged by FRSC patrol team in Lekki, Lagos State during the course of his arrest for violating established road traffic regulations. "As a public friendly organisation, we consider it expedient to bring to the notice of the general public, the true picture of what transpired during the arrest. "To begin with, Mr Muyiwa Akinbola was apprehended on Wednesday 3/02/2021 for Use of Phone While Driving (UPD). Upon other checks carried out on the vehicle, it was discovered by the patrol team that the vehicle had no number plates visibly displaced at the appropriate spot on the vehicle. "With the growing rate of car theft recorded on our roads in recent times, the team pressed on him to ascertain the status of the car. When confronted about the vehicle registration, the offender got infuriated and a series of arguments ensued after which he left to the bank to pay his fine, thinking that could stop the necessary investigation into the status of the car. "When he came back to secure the release of the vehicle, he was further interrogated about a commercial number plate (KTU 116 XY) purportedly belonging to the vehicle, placed on his dashboard to which he offered no explanation. "Further investigation carried out by the command revealed that the number plate belongs to another vehicle entirely which raised the bar for suspicion and gave the officers reasons to doubt the ownership of the vehicle under reference. "Seeing that he could not provide required proof, the offender left in anger and came back with his friend, wife and baby and impressed on the wife to make the trending video, claiming that his finger was injured by the personnel of the command and threatened to attack the command with mobs." Kazeem also stated that the Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi, has directed the Lagos State Sector Commander to carry out a thorough investigation and forward the outcome of the investigation to its national headquarters for necessary actions. He also said the entire team involved in the case had been recalled to the Lagos State Sector Command for interrogation.
