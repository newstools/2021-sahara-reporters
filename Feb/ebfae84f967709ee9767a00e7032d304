Gunmen kidnapped the paramount ruler of Ikuru town in the Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State, HRM Aaron Ikuru, at his residence on Sunday night. Also, some boat travellers, including a lecturer at the University of Port Harcourt, who were sailing from Andoni to Port Harcourt were abducted and whisked away by armed men suspected to be pirates. Illustration The monarch’s palace spokesperson, Maurice Ikuru, confirmed the incident to The PUNCH on Monday morning. “Yes, it’s true. It happened about 8:30 or 9:00 pm,” he said. When contacted, spokesman for the State Police Command, Nnamdi Omoni, confirmed that some Port Harcourt-bound travellers were kidnapped but that their identities were unknown to him. “I can confirm that some persons who were coming back from Andoni were ambushed and kidnapped. An investigation is ongoing to get the details,” Omoni said.
