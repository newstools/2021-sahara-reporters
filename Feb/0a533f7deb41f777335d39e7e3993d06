The Cross River State Police Command has paraded a female student of Community Secondary School, Ikot Ewa in the Akpabuyo Local Government Area of the state, Promise Idorenyin, who was arrested for unlawful possession of a locally made pistol. State Police Commissioner, Sikiru Akande dismissed initial reports that alleged that the 17-year-old girl took the gun to school to shoot her teacher.  The commissioner said the double-barrelled gun was discovered in her school bag by the principal of the school. He said the police discovered from their investigation that the girl was taking the locally made gun to a blacksmith. Akande also said an investigation was ongoing to unravel the mystery surrounding the ownership of the gun adding that a suspect, Okon Effiong, had been arrested and more details would be made known soon. Speaking, Promise claimed to be taking the pistol to a blacksmith before it was confiscated by the school principal. She said, “I am a member of Sky Queen Confraternity, I am just an ordinary member. I don’t hold any position in the group, I have known the owner of the gun who is my 'man-friend' (boyfriend) since last year, he sleeps with me and supports me with little things, but he is not the one paying my school fees. “My mother knows about him because he visits me at our house and sometimes he sleeps over at my place because I have my own room and in the morning he goes back to his own house.” Her boyfriend, Mr Effiong, said he had been intimate with her since August 2020. “I am a married man with six children, I did not give her the gun, she took it herself where I kept it under the bed,” he said. “I started sleeping with her last August. Her mother knows me, I have been doing small something (sic) on her head. They know she is my wife.”
