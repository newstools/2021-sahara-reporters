The crisis rocking the Isoko South Local Government chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Delta State on Friday took a new twist with the suspension of the party chairman, Godspower Obaro, from office over what party leaders and officials called 'insubordination, misconduct, and highhandedness'.While giving other reasons for the suspension of the party's chairman to include 'gross incompetence, immaturity, lack of respect for party leaders and members, the party's leaders and officials said the embattled former chairman was imposed on the party and was not competent to lead it anymore.  The embattled former chairman, Obaro, had on Thursday unilaterally sacked the Isoko South PDP campaign chairman, Ferguson Onwo, member representing Isoko South constituency 2 in the state House of Assembly and the campaign Director General (DG), Orezi Esievo, and executive assistant to the state governor with a summons to appear before the party's disciplinary committee.A letter titled "Vote Of No Confidence And Suspension Of The Chairman Of Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), Isoko South Chapter, Chief Obaro Godspower", addressed to the state chairman of the PDP, Kingsley Esiso, noted that Obaro does not have what it takes to lead the party at the local government level successfully.The letter which was signed by Agbidi Louis, Secretary, PDP Isoko South; Roseline Uwubiti, Financial Secretary; Onoriode Amagada, Treasurer; Imoto Louis; Organising Secretary; Kelvin Abighe, Publicity Secretary, among leaders and executive members of the party as well as various ward chairmen, the chieftains disassociated themselves from the purported sacking of the campaign council chairman, Onwo and the DG, Esievor.The party leaders and officials, however, passed a vote of confidence on the Isoko South PDP campaign chairman, Ferguson Onwo; a member representing Isoko South constituency 2 in the state House of Assembly, and the campaign Director General (DG), Orezi Esievo.The letter said, "We, the majority members of Isoko South Local Government Area executive members and 7 out of the 11 ward chairmen of our great party, PDP, hereby pass a vote of no confidence on the chairman of PDP Isoko South LGA, Chief Obaro God's power, and suspend him from office for the following reasons.

"Insubordination, highhandedness, gross incompetence, immaturity, lack of respect for party leaders and members. Godspower lacks the requisite candour, wisdom, knowledge, and maturity to boost the fortunes of the party in Isoko South LGA."Flowing from the above, Chief Obaro Godspower is to hand over the party's properties in his possession to the vice-chairman of the party in the local government area forthwith. This is in line with chapter 6 of the PDP constitution."Meanwhile, a one-time chairman of the party, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told SaharaReporters that the crisis rocking the party could be attributed to the highhandedness and political interest of the Managing Director of the Delta State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (DESOPADEC), Askia Ogieh, who sees the party as his personal estate."The crisis in the party is being caused by Askia. Few leaders of the party, after receiving some gratifications from the Managing Director of the Delta State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (DESOPADEC), Askia Ogieh, the now-suspended Isoko South PDP chairman, Godspower Obaro, was imposed on us. It was done so that Askia could hijack the party structures during elections, especially the forthcoming 2023 general elections, which the commission's MD is interested in contesting," the source alleged.
