A 72-year-old pastor of Cherubim and Seraphim Church, Oke-Aseyori, Iyana Church, Monatan, Ibadan, Mr. Jimo Odunayo, has been arrested for allegedly defiling a 13-year-old girl, Rasaq Aisha. Odunayo was arrested along with Opeyemi Rasaq, who was also said to have played a role in the crime committed by the pastor.  The state police Commissioner in the state, Ngozi Onadeko who paraded them at the state police command on Wednesday, said the pastor was arrested for having unlawful carnal knowledge of the girl between 2019 and June 2020. She said, "The suspect and the parents of the victim live within the same compound and the victim always goes to the living room of the suspect to watch television. Consequently, the suspect took advantage of the prevailing situation to have unlawful carnal knowledge of her four distinctly independent times. "The suspect made a confessional statement to that effect, admitting that the allegation is true. The case was transferred to state CID Iyaganku, Ibadan where it was charged to court." Also paraded was a 56-year-old lawyer, Remi-Oladiti, who defiled a 14-year-old girl, Fatima Souwara, in Bodija, Ibadan. Speaking on the incident, the police boss said; "In the process, one Remi Oladiti gave her a big Cola drink suspected to contain some form of sedative-hypnotic drug to drink which made her unconscious. "Following her comatose state, Remi Oladiti who had already made a confessional statement, forcefully had unlawful carnal knowledge of her.  On regaining consciousness, she found herself fully unclothed on Remi Oladiti's bed while blood was dripping out from her private part." In an interview with SaharaReporters, Oladiti admittedly had carnal knowledge of the victim but denied giving any drug to the victim. The police commissioner said a medical examination revealed that the victim had had 29 weeks’ pregnancy for Oladiti.
