No fewer than 63 residents of Obigbo in Rivers State who were arrested and detained by the Nigerian Army and the Department of the State Services have regained their freedom after four months. The detainees were freed after condemnation and pressure by human rights groups, including the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law – based in Onitsha, Anambra State.  SaharaReporters learnt that they had been incarcerated since October 2020 at the Mogadishu Barracks in Abuja but were finally arraigned in court last Wednesday, February 10, 2021. A Magistrates' Court sitting in Wuse, Abuja, received a bail application filed on their behalf by human rights’ lawyers and the Obigbo residents were thereafter freed from the military custody. The Intersociety in its report on the incident alleged that the Obigbo residents were detained at Mogadishu Army Barracks, Annex B at Asokoro, DSS Training Centre at Central Business District and its abandoned facility at Zuba and the Nigeria Police College at Suleja in Niger State. The report was signed by Emeka Umeagbalasi, Intersociety Board Chair, Chinwe Umeche, Head, Democracy and Good Governance, Obianuju Igboeli, Head, Civil Liberties and Rule of Law and Chidimma Udegbunam, Head, Campaign and Publicity. The Intersociety also released the names of the 63 freed abductees.
