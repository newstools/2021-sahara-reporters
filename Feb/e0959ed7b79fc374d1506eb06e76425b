The family of Abudu has petitioned the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission over the death of 40-year-old Abudu Adedayo Temitope, who was killed by a yet-to-be-identified assailant in Johannesburg, South Africa. In the petition signed by a brother of the deceased, Olatunde Mustapha Abudu, he implored the commission to investigate the killing of his brother, Adedayo, and bring the culprits to justice.  He narrated that his brother, who lived on Delvers Street, Central Johannesburg, South Africa, was gunned down on January 5, 2021, by an unknown gunman “for no just cause.” Mustapha said Adedayo, who was assassinated in cold blood, was rushed to Hillbrow Community Health Centre by some eyewitnesses where he was pronounced dead. The deceased, a native of Ijebu Ode in Ogun State, Nigeria, was married with three children and left behind five siblings, who are all based in Nigeria. The petitioner claimed that Adedayo was a law-abiding citizen who was going about his lawful business in South Africa and had no criminal records both in South Africa and Nigeria.
