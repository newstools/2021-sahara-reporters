Solomon Akuma, the young pharmacist who has been abducted and detained at the Force Criminal Investigation Department, Abuja, for over 11 months for allegedly threatening President Muhammadu Buhari, will be appearing at the Federal High Court, Abuja, tomorrow, Wednesday, February 24. The 29-year-old was arrested for tweeting, “Pay a Russian Sniper to eliminate Buhari and Abba Kyari”, in reply to a certain tweet by a popular Twitter user, Tunde Omotoye, who had earlier tweeted, “$1,000,000 hits your account. Your next move?”.  It was an obvious Akuma’s tweet was a joke which the average Nigerian Twitter user would refer to as ‘banter’ – a word used in describing comments deliberately made by any Twitter user with an intent to draw online traffic and spur online discussion or Twitter trends. However, despite the fact that the young pharmacist did not appear to have the capacity nor the intention to hire a Russian sniper to eliminate a certain Buhari or Abba Kyari, the late Chief of Staff to the Nigerian President, the Nigerian authorities still went ahead to abduct and kept him in solitary confinement without trial.

3 Months Ago On Wednesday, February 24, Solomon Akuma will be appearing in court again from detention after he had been previously denied bail by a Federal High Court judge in Abuja. The matter, which was earlier expected to resume for ruling on the “admissibility of documents” before Justice Folashade Giwa-Ogunbajo weeks ago, was stalled following the announcement by the court registrar that the judge would not be sitting.
