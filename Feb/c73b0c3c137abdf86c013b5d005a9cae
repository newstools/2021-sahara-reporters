The new Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa says he has a cordial relationship with Ibrahim Magu, former acting chairman of the anti-graft agency. Magu was suspended in July 2020 over allegations of mismanaging recovered loot, while he served as acting chairman of the EFCC. Ibrahim Magu However, President Muhammadu Buhari last Tuesday asked the senate to confirm Bawa as the substantive chairman of the anti-graft agency. While responding to questions from senators who grilled him on Wednesday, he said he has a cordial relationship with Magu. “I have a cordial relationship with the former Acting Chairman. He congratulated me on my nomination and wished me success,” Bawa said. Magu’s travails followed a memo by Abubakar Malami, Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), who accused him of grave malfeasance. He was subsequently arrested, detained and suspended as the acting chairman of the anti-graft agency. A panel headed by Ayo Salami, a retired judge, was inaugurated by the President Muhammadu Buhari to probe the allegations against the former EFCC boss. However, the outcome of the investigation against Magu has not been made public since the panel handed over its report to Buhari in November 2020.
