There was tension in the Ijeshatedo area of Surulere in Lagos State on Monday and Tuesday when cult gangs unleashed mayhem in the Ijeshatedo axis of Surulere, forcing residents to close their shops and stay indoors. Eyewitnesses told SaharaReporters that the disturbance caused by the cult gangs started around 6 pm on Tuesday around Sanya bus stop on the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway which later extended to nearby Ilamoye Street.  A resident noted that the police at Ijesha had were contacted but no security official had arrived as of press time. “The policemen will later come to start raiding and arresting innocent residents. The cult clashes have enveloped Omolabake Street and Doyin Odediran Street which are adjacent to Ilamoye. They are Eiye and Aye cult groups. “The hoodlums were armed with machetes, locally made guns, and kitchen knives. They shot into the air to scare residents away and everybody stayed indoors. No shop could open in the area. “We don’t have any death recorded at the moment. But the thugs are still disturbing the peace of the community,” the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. Cult clashes have been a major menace in Lagos State with the Eiye and Aye cult members at the centre of it, a situation that has led to killings and destruction of properties. According to the police, the areas so far identified as flashpoints for cult wars, violence, and killings in recent times are Ijede and Ogijo areas of Ikorodu; Alapere area of Ketu; Ojo and Ajangbadi areas; Oyingbo, Ajegunle, Ijora Badia, Ojuelegba and Fadeyi areas. Others are Onipanu, Oshodi, Mushin, Somolu, Akoka, and Bariga areas. Police sources confirmed that the age-long cult war between the Eiye and Aye confraternities as well as the robberies and assaults against residents have also intensified in those areas.
