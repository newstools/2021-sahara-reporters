Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, has promised to visit Kagara, the Niger community, where some students and staff members of a government school were abducted on Wednesday morning. Some students and staff members of Government Science Secondary School, Kagara, headquarters of Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State, were abducted early Wednesday morning.  According to Daily Trust, Gumi described the incident as unfortunate and promised to promised to go to the communitu during a visit to the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello. He said he was on his way to Kebbi State but decided to stop over in Minna, Niger State capital, to speak with the governor over the kidnap incident. The cleric said it was his first time of visiting Niger, adding that his discussion with the governor was to enable the government find a solution to insecurity. “The governor and I spoke on several ways to deal with insecurity in a holistic manner and find solutions to the insecurity problem in the state,” he said. Two weeks ago, Gumi had met with bandits in their hideouts, appealing to them to embrace peace. He later asked the Nigerian and state governments to offer amnesty to bandits, saying dialogue is the solution to insecurity. But some stakeholders, including Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, had rejected the recommendation. They insisted that bandits must be punished for the crimes they committed and should not be given amnesty.
