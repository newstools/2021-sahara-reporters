The Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, and some northern governors have visited Shasha Market in Ibadan to assess the destruction at the scene of the clash between Yoruba and Hausa communities. The governors who joined Makinde were Kebbi State Governor, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu; Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje; Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle and Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sanni.  They came into Ibadan on Monday night to visit the area where violence raged last Friday and Saturday, leading to destruction of lives and property. Makinde, who had expressed shock at the level of destruction during his earlier visit to the market on Sunday, said those who suffered losses would be compensated. Makinde and his Ondo State counterpart, Rotimi Akeredolu, who is also the chairman of South-West Governors’ Forum, had visited the place on Sunday and urged the two factions to embrace peace. Governor Bagudu, who lamented the sad incident between the two groups, however, promised that the northern governors would give necessary support to Governor Makinde in restoring normalcy and redeeming the lost property. He said, “The Nigeria Governors’ Forum will also support him (Makinde) to ensure that those who have lost their livelihoods are supported in this trying period.”
