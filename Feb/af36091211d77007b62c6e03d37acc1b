Addressing the crowd that gathered to speak with him at Oja Odan, Igboho said, "We have come to Ogun State to rescue our people from the activities of Fulani herdsmen. "We learnt that Fulani kidnappers are disturbing our people in this state; kidnapping them, raping them. This is our land, this is our nation, Yoruba nation, enough is enough, we don't want Fulani kidnappers anymore. "The Ogun State government invited us and that's because the government is good. The governor of this state is a good man; he has shown that he loves his people. He knows that the poor are suffering and is ready to protect them. He identified that the same people he is governing over are those that are being killed and kidnapped. "Our people can't come home; the kidnappers have made our expressways unsafe for us. All the elders of Yorubaland and every one of us; we are not happy with what is happening. We are going into the bush to see those who are threatening our people. We don't want herdsmen again; we want to send them away."
