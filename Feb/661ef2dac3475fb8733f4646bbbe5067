The incident has thrown the community dwellers into apprehension and mourning, while the police in the state have beefed up security in the affected area and adjoining settlements. It was reliably gathered that parents in the neighbouring areas had withdrawn their children and wards from schools when the news of the attack reached them. “The Fulani have started launching mayhem on our people here again. They went to Owode Ketu village and killed a man and his wife before daybreak. “Right now, we have pulled our children from their schools. Our children are at home now and people have returned from their farms and markets because we don’t want to be caught unawares by their atrocities. “We had to do that because we don’t know what could follow. The tension is high now in Eggua and other surrounding places. Our people are afraid and panicky.” When asked about the reaction of the Fulani community in the area, Popoola said, “We can’t see any of them to hold responsible. We are just discussing how we can resist them in case there will be an attack, and also awaiting the decision of the security agents. “I don’t know if the police have arrested anybody in the area but I heard that policemen are patrolling, trying to prevent potential attacks.”
