6 Hours Ago  WATCH: Military, DSS and Police Operatives Attempt To Arrest Sunday Igboho On Ibadan-Lagos Expressway https://t.co/TIs5X2VUrT pic.twitter.com/6rIhQhD70x  The Punch newspaper quoted Igboho as saying that he was never invited by the security forces before an attempt was made to arrest him. When asked if he would honour a police invitation, Igboho said, “Go and ask them to invite Gumi and Shekau first before disturbing me. Let them face the bandits instead.” Igboho also said he would not run away, adding that he had returned to his base in Ibadan. When asked if he would go into hiding, he said, “What for? I am in the neighbourhood. I cannot run.” Igboho also revealed that his bank account was initially frozen but the restriction was lifted recently. The Yoruba activist, who has been in the news for serving a quit notice on Fulani herdsmen in some parts of the South-West, said he had done nothing wrong but fight for the rights of his people.
