Nobel laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari clearly does not understand the pervading herdsmen’s violent crisis in the country and that the president is not in charge of the situation.

You must pick up this slack for our own situation, our own salvation, and this is one of the things we engaged in and that is why I resent this becoming individualised. Wole Soyinka is just another individual, just like another farmer, another student and I wanted people to understand this. “What happened to me with this incident is just typical of what is happening to millions of people all over the country and we cannot just sit still. “I just read the reports that the herdsmen should be compensated.
