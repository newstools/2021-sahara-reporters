Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, on Wednesday, said he has no interest in the rumoured presidential ambition of All Progressives Congress chieftain, Bola Tinubu, in 2023.Fayose, who stated this on a PUNCH Live interview, expressed confidence that his party, the Peoples Democratic Party, would produce Nigeria’s president in the 2023 general elections.  He said, “Bola Tinubu is a leader in the West. It is a statement of fact” but noted that he has not met or spoken with the former Lagos State governor in years.Fayose said, “I have never met former Governor Ahmed Bola Tinubu in the last three years and I have never spoken with him on the phone once. So, I don’t know how they are tying the relationship politically.“To the best of my knowledge, I am not a member of APC. I have no influence on how he will become if he wants to become. I have no interest; the only interest I have is that a PDP president must be put in place.”“If this country exists for the peace and enjoyment of all us, we will not be talking about it is APC, it is PDP…A PDP man cannot attend a function with an APC man. An APC man cannot greet a PDP man; we can’t continue like that; it shows the level of hypocrisy,” he added.The ex-governor of Ekiti also said he had not abandoned his ambition to be Nigeria’s president. “The office of the president is a noble one and I will love to be the president of Nigeria if the opportunity permits,” Fayose stated.
