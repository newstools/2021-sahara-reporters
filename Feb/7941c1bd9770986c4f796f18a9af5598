Counsel for the defendant, H. A. Omikunle, made an oral application for his client’s bail. However, Shamsuddeen Bashir, counsel for the EFCC, opposed the application due to the defendant's failure to keep to the terms of the administrative bail earlier granted to her. Justice Akinyemi adjourned the case till March 4 for determination of the bail application and ordered that the defendant should be remanded at the Nigerian Correctional Centre, Ibara, Abeokuta.
