Speaking on Channels television's Sunrise Daily, Presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu said he was not aware of the imminent announcement of a new police chief. He stated, "The President returns to Abuja (from Katsina) on Tuesday. He should be on his desk by Wednesday. I don't know when he will do this. One thing I can assure you is that in places sensitive like that, no vacuum will subsist, so therefore, the system will take care of itself." Shehu also stressed that the appointment of the next IGP would not be based on ethnic considerations. "The President will rather have an Inspector-General of Police who will make you and I safer, protect life and property than one who is more pronounced by his tribal marks," he noted. Shehu said it is impracticable for top security appointments to be made based on ethnicity or regions. The spokesman added that the appointment would be based on who can best help to protect lives and property across the country.
