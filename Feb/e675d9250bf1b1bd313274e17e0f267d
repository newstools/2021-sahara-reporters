We grow up and attend schools together. People from diverse ethnic groups do inter-marry and give birth to lovely children," he said.Olubadan stated that he was surprised that a crisis could break out in Shasa culminating in large-scale destruction, such as burning properties.He said, "Immediately the report of the crisis got to us in the palace yesterday, the Governor of Oyo State, Engr.
