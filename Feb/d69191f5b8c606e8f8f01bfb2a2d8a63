Former Head of State and Chairman of the National Peace Committee, Gen Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.), has said the growing tension in the wake of the herdsmen and ethnic crises in the country will affect farm harvests in 2021. Abdulsalami added that such frictions could also lead the country to a point of no return.  Speaking with journalists at his Hilltop residence in Minna, Niger State capital, the former head of state described the recent happenings in some parts of the country as unfortunate. According to Daily Trust, Abdulsalami said, “We appeal to the citizens of our dear country who have borne so much pains and suffering to remain resilient and patient. “Thousands of our people are homeless and refugees across the length and breadth of their own country. We know what farmers have faced in the last few years and the harvests will be a serious challenge this year. “Therefore, let us all rally together in these hard times, make the required sacrifices and remain vigilant, standing by one another.” He appealed to governors to tone down their rhetoric and take full responsibility for managing the divergent voices and frustrations within their states. He said, “It is true that we are all in a state of fear and collective anxiety. However, the last thing we need is for the enemy to sense a lack of unity on our part or a break in our ranks. “We appeal to the new service chiefs and Inspector-General of Police to rise to the urgent demands of the moment by rallying their troops and designing the best strategy for ending the tragic war that has continued to consumed and destroy the foundations of our dear country. “We hope that based on their field experiences in the war, they can draw up a well-coordinated programme to ensure that all our resources are deployed to achieve the much-needed victory in this avoidable war.”
