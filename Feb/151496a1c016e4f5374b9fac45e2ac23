A former Presidential candidate of the Young Democratic Party (YDP), Kingsley Moghalu, has warned President Muhammadu Buhari of the grave consequences of his government’s failure to stop the impunity of killer herdsmen and bandits in Nigeria. He said the problem could escalate into an ethnic crisis if not properly addressed. File Photo: Kingsley Moghalu

In this context, I deplore the recent killings of innocent Nigerians of Northern extraction in Oyo State. “As a Nigerian who has played a role in international efforts to rebuild several failed states after destructive internal conflicts including Rwanda after the genocide in 1994, I know firsthand where such trends can lead. I call upon President Muhammadu Buhari to act decisively to end the scourge of killer herdsmen and bandits. “It is a clear augury of state failure when in any part of Nigeria, terrorists of any description can attack defenceless civilians without consequence. Clearly, the Nigerian state has lost its monopoly of the use of force. “This is time for leadership by President Buhari. No one is, or should be, above the laws of Nigeria. We simply cannot have a country in which the authorities act decisively to squash peaceful protests by citizens but appear impotent against terrorists and terrorism.”
