He, however, said Nigeria can only benefit if it can abide by WTO rules and consult the DG on issues involving global trade. According to Ekpo, the DG is not only for Nigerians and Africans but for the whole world. Speaking with SaharaReporters, he said, “Okonjo-Iweala is very well qualified for the job. I am glad she was appointed as WTO DG, first woman, first African and as expected, she will look out for the interest of Africa and Nigeria but it depends on how best Africa and Nigeria will use her so that we will get a good deal in the WTO arrangement. “WTO is a global institution but definitely, she will have some sentiments for Africa and Nigeria, it depends on how best we can optimise her position as DG for Africa and Nigeria. “For her to do her job well, we should make sure we don’t violate the rules of the WTO and consult her when there are issues involved in global trade.”
