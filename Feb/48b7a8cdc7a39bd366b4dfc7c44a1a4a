Okechukwu Nnodim, a Punch reporter, who was kidnapped in his Abuja residence recently, has regained his freedom from his abductors. The journalist was released alongside two young men, who were also kidnapped by the criminals.  Nnodim and his fellow captives were released around 11 pm on Saturday night after spending three nights in captivity. The development comes days after they were abducted. Nnodim was abducted around 11pm on Wednesday in his residence, off Arab Road in Kubwa, a suburb in the Federal Capital Territory. SaharaReporters cannot ascertain if any ransom was paid but the kidnappers had earlier demanded a random of N10million and later N5million to release him. The Federal Capital Territory ( FCT ) has now become a major kidnapping zone, even during the day, despite being the seat of the Nigerian government.
