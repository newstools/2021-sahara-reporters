It was an intense battle, the terrorists also suffered casualties but they were able to overwhelm the soldiers,” a military source said. The attack comes barely one month after some soldiers were killed in an ambush in the community. Boko Haram and its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province, have killed thousands and displaced millions in North-Eastern Nigeria. Nigerian army has repeatedly claimed that the insurgency had been largely defeated and frequently underplays any losses. In the past months, soldiers have been targeted by the insurgents, waiting in ambush on their paths. The Boko Haram insurgency has caused over 40,000 deaths and displaced millions of individuals mainly in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. The terror group wants an Islamic caliphate in northern Nigeria.
