Then they entered my car, pointed their guns at me, and asked me to drive. "They forced me to give them my ATM card and take them to different ATM points where they withdrew all the money in my account. Afterwards, they called my family members with my phone, demanding money that would serve as a ransom for my release. "So, it was at that point one my relations called the Chairman of the Bayelsa Vigilante Force, who mobilised his men and rescued me from my abductors."
