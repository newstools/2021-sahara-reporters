Following the attack on the convoy of Benue state governor, Samuel Ortom, by unknown gunmen recently, his Rivers state counterpart, Nyesom Wike, has warned that the Nigerian government will be held responsible if Ortom is assassinated. He stressed that if the Benue state governor was killed, the country could be plunged into another civil war. Rivers Governor Wike Wike stated this while reacting to an attempt on Governor Ortom’s life by 15 gunmen who trailed him to a riverbank in Tyo Mu along Makurdi/Gboko Road in the Makurdi Local Government Area of state on Saturday. “If you kill Ortom, then be prepared to bury Nigeria. If anything happens to Governor Ortom, the Federal Government will be held responsible and they should be prepared that there will be no more Nigeria," he said. The Rivers State Governor recalled how the former General Officer Commanding (GOC) 6 Division of the Nigerian Army in Port Harcourt, Major General Jamil Sarham, and the All Progressives Congress chieftains had allegedly concluded plans to assassinate him during the 2019 general elections. Governor Wike described it as disturbing the growing trend where the lives of incumbent governors are brazenly threatened.
