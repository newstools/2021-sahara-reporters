Patients at Nigeria's first teaching hospital, University Teaching Hospital (UCH) in Ibadan, Oyo State are currently having trouble getting water and are being forced to make use of sachet water. A journalist who was admitted at the Haematology day care unit on Tuesday lamented that people find it difficult to flush toilets, let alone getting water to do other things.  Another source who works in the country's first teaching hospital confirmed to SaharaReporters that relations of patients have been struggling to get water for their sick loved ones. The source said toilets are sometimes left unflushed for some time as a result of the water scarcity. The spokesperson for the UCH, Toye Akinrinola confirmed the development in a text message, saying the management was carrying out some rehabilitation works in the hospital. He said, "It is true that water supply in UCH has been epileptic in recent weeks. We are overhauling the entire water system. In fact, 5 blocks in the hospital have been shut down for massive renovation. This hasn't happened in 63 years. "It is regrettable that our services are being disrupted, but in the next two weeks, we should be done with the renovation."
