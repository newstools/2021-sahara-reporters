A former Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo on Friday says he once tested positive for the coronavirus. Obasanjo disclosed this in Abeokuta while speaking at a colloquium put in place to celebrate his 84th birthday.  The programme was held at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta. He said, “It will surprise you that I was tested positive for covid-19. I called them to come and test me, they came on a Saturday, I didn’t get the result till Wednesday and it came out positive but I didn’t see any symptoms. “When they came three days after, they tested me and said I was negative, that is three days after I tested positive. “My daughter, Iyabo, is an epidemiologist and I called her to explain. She said maybe they tested me at the later stage of my being positive. “I told her I had no symptoms and she said it could be a faulty result. But I was tested positive. Since then I have been tested three times negative, so, if you want to come near me, you can come near me. “It is nothing to worry about, when I was tested positive, my household were running from me, I told them to stay in their place while I stay in mine.”
