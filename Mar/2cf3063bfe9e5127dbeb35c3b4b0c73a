The Olori-Ilu of Imope town in the Ijebu North Local Government Area of Ogun State, Alademeta Kolawole Omotayo, has now spent two days in the den of kidnappers who waylaid and took him away on Saturday.  The ruler was abducted on Saturday while returning from a visit to a neigbouring town.  He was moving in a butter-coloured Sport Utility Vehicle whose number plate read W 3 J9 Ogun when the gunmen shot at his vehicle and abducted him.  He was reportedly kidnapped along Oke Eri-Imope Road, while driving down from Ijebu-Ode, where he had gone to see someone.  A close ally of the kidnapped community leader recalled that the abductors fired bullets to deflate two tyres of his car. "The bullets also pierced the engine, giving the kidnappers an opportunity to pull him out of the car and drag him into the bush,” a source disclosed.  The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the incident, said the police had launched a manhunt for the attackers, but the traditional ruler had yet to be released.  “He told us he was going to Ijebu Ode,” a source said. “On his way back home, around 3:00pm, unknown gunmen accosted him at Oke-Eri, a community not far from here and took him away. They didn’t go with his vehicle. They left his vehicle on the road,” another source stated.  SaharaReporters learnt that local vigilantes and hunters had joined the search party for the traditional ruler, who is also said to be the President of Ijebu Igbo Club and a member of Ijebu-Ode Club.  It is not clear yet whether the abductors had communicated with the palace to demand a ransom, but police sources said the gunmen were believed to be some of the rampaging criminal herdsmen.
