Commuters and residents in Akure, Ondo state have reported an increase in disruptive encounters with herdsmen and cattle grazing along its major roads despite Governor Rotimi Akeredolu’s order banning open grazing in the state. Some residents told SaharaReporters that some cows on Monday blocked a road in Ayedun, a popular street in the state capital disrupting vehicular movement for many minutes. File Photo: Grazing cows
Post Nigeria It was gathered that motorists were forced to stop their vehicles to pave the way for the cows moving freely on the road. Cows were also sighted moving freely along Aule Road and in front of NNPC mega station, along Ilesha/Owo expressway. Akeredolu had in January banned movement of cattle within the cities and highways, underage grazing and night grazing. Weeks after, governors of the South-West states in a meeting in Akure banned open grazing of cattle in the region. “Today, the South-West governors held a security stakeholders’ meeting in Ondo State. The meeting was attended by our brother governors from Kebbi and Jigawa States; security chiefs, SW zone led by the AIG Zone 11 and leaders from the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria,” Seyi Makinde, governor of Oyo state said. “Collectively, we resolved to ban open grazing in all parts of the south west. In Oyo State, we already have a law against open grazing which will continue to be implemented by our security agencies.” In February, the state Executive Council approved a bill to formally ban open grazing and forwarded it to the State House of Assembly.
