An up-and-coming comedian, Graciox Talker, has cried out that an operative of the defunct Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad threatened to kill him. Talker alleged this in a video posted on his Twitter handle Graciox_Talker @GracioxT on Wednesday.  He also said the operative gave him seven days to pray as he was hell-bent on killing him when he called him on a WhatsApp video call. In the video, Talker begged Nigerians to help save his life from the security agent, whom he said showed him an AK-47. “Good evening, everyone watching this video clip. I’m Gracioux Talker, I’m a comedian. This is to use this medium and opportunity to tell you that this is not a comedy skit. This is about my life,” Talker said. “My life is at risk in the hands of someone I don’t know fully well. He’s a member of Federal SARS. This guy called me yesterday on a video call on WhatsApp. He showed me an AK-47 gun and told me to keep on praying that my time starts now, that in a week’s time, he is going to be done with me.  Please help, a SARS officer is after my life, am not safe at all, I need a cover plzzzzzðð­ð­ð­ð­ pic.twitter.com/VcMvdYENBV  “I don’t know what I have done to this guy.
