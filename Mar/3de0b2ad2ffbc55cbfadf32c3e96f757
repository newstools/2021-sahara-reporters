A leader of the All Progressives Grand Alliance in Zamfara State, Dr Sani Shinkafi, has accused the All Progressives Congress leaders in the state of offering money to bandits to refuse to release the abducted Jangebe schoolgirls. He said that their aim was to sabotage the peace efforts of Governor Bello Matawalle.  Shinkafi, who was the 2019 governorship candidate of APGA in Zamfara State, made the allegation during a press briefing. More than 300 pupils of the Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe, were abducted in the last week of February before they were rescued last week. He said, “I, therefore, challenge politicians from both the ruling and opposition parties to subject their telephone numbers to security checks since I am confident that the story that will come out of that process would be shocking.” According to him, the security checks on the personal telephones of the selected politicians should be from February 25 to the time when the girls were released. Continuing, Shinkafi said some APC members in Zamfara State were desperate to ensure that Matawalle failed in his commitment to transform the state, pointing out that security operatives needed to be active in curtailing the insecurity situation affecting the country. “The APC-led Federal Government should stop playing the 2023 politics with banditry in Zamfara State. The APC leadership missed the point due to pettiness, contempt and attempts to play to the gallery,” he added. Shinkafi urged the youth not to allow themselves to be used as stooges for burning down Nigeria by some desperate and selfish politicians, advising them to focus more on building the nation. Shinkafi also called on the government to come up with an initiative that will help in empowering the youth by creating job opportunities for them.
