The governor of Yobe State and chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, has secretly married his fourth wife at a very private ceremony in Abuja. SaharaReporters gathered that the governor’s new bride is Gumsu Abacha, one of the daughters of former military Head of State, the late General Sani Abacha.  The low-key marriage was solemnised at Mohammed Abacha’s residence in Abuja during the weekend. An aide to the governor said the event was performed secretly to avoid public criticism. Gumsu, 45, was previously married to Cameroonian multi-billionaire, Bayero Fadil Mohamadou. In 2019, the governor married his predecessor’s daughter, Adama Ibrahim Gaidam, barely 24 hours after taking the oath of office.Ummi Adama Gaidam, who was studying in Saudi Arabia at the time, was married as his third wife. Buni was National Secretary of the APC when Gaidam declared interest in having him as his successor. Like it was with his marriage to Ummi Adama, the daughter of his predecessor, Ibrahim Gaidam, his marriage to Gumsu is also said to have been done for political reasons. Gumsu, the second daughter of the late former Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Abacha, and Mohamadou separated in 2020. They were married for about 20 years before the union hit the rocks, and now she has found a new home in Buni's house.
