Popular comedian, Debo Adebayo, alias Mr Macaroni has taken a swipe at the Nigeria Police Force following the backlash the security agency received on social media over its message to commemorate the International Women’s Day. In a tweet he shared, Mr Macaroni said no amount of ‘packaging and branding’ could erase the awful and bitter experiences officials of the police force had put their fellow Nigerians through. He also asked if they had any conscience.  His tweet read, “Just go through the quoted tweets and comments here! No amount of packaging and branding can erase the awful and bitter experiences that you people have put your fellow Nigerians through. Don’t you people have conscience?” Just go through the quoted tweets and comments here!
