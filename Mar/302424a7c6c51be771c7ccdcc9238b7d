Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has withdrawn a suit against a Bayelsa State-born blogger and owner of Naija Live TV, Mr. Saint Onitsha over a report about the governor. The report, published on May 2, 2020, alleged that N7 billion Covid-19 isolation centre purportedly built by the state government was blown away by a rainstorm. The state government also withdrew the case of defamation filed against the blogger at the Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. The authorities of the Department of State Services (DSS) had last year arrested, detained, and arraigned the blogger before the Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa over the alleged publication of the collapse of the N7 billion Isolation centre located at the Federal Medical Centre, Lokoja in Kogi State. According to the DSS, investigation and arrest of the Bayelsa News blogger have shown that the publication is no doubt an orchestration to tarnish the image of Bello, and incite the public against his administration. But at todayâ€™s sitting of the Federal High Court in Yenagoa, the presiding Judge, Justice Abimbola Awogboro, struck out the case of defamation against the Bayelsa News Blogger based on the request of the state governor. The accused news blogger had earlier tendered an unreserved apology to the governor, Bello, and the people of the state before the case against him was withdrawn by the Kogi State Government. The news Blogger, who was full of praises for the Kogi State Governor, said "First of all, I want to appreciate the Kogi state governor for playing a fatherly role. I appreciate him because he has decided to forgive me as a father and I take him as a father from today. On the professional angle, as journalists, we do confirm stories before we publish. I will still make sure that going forward, I will get to the root of all my stories before publication."
