A woman identified as Justina Eje has been arrested by the police for allegedly stabbing her husband to death in the Ikorodu area of Lagos state. Eje, who was paraded before journalists at the command headquarters in Ikeja by the State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, allegedly stabbed her husband, Edwin Anduaka with a kitchen knife during a domestic quarrel. LIB Recounting how the incident occurred, Eje claimed to have been separated from her husband, who fathered her three children, for quite some time. According to her, it was during a heated argument she mistakenly stabbed her husband in the stomach. She said, “My late husband came to my house in Ikorodu on that fateful day. While he was in my house, he wanted to collect a chain and clothes from me which he did. We later started an argument, I tried to calm him down but he refused. "He left but came back to meet me at my workplace the next day. He said he wanted to collect the children’s clothes but I told him they would be going to school. I pleaded with him. "All this while I was holding a knife and he started beating me. Unfortunately, the knife I was holding pierced his stomach and he fell. He was rushed to the hospital where he was confirmed dead.”
