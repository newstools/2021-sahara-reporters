Soldiers of an unidentified battalion in Operation Lafiya Dole have protested their posting to a location in the Theatre of Operation.  According to Channels Television, the aggrieved soldiers at the Maimalari barracks besieged the headquarters of the Theatre Command in Borno State, shooting sporadically into the air on Thursday night following their redeployment.

Some of the soldiers who spoke under anonymity recall how a whole unit that went for reinforcement when Marte was captured last month, perished under the superior firepower of the enemy forces.  The Media Coordinator for Operation Lafiya Dole, Colonel Ado Isa, confirmed the incident.  While blaming the protest on the soldiersâ€™ minor admin/welfare, he said the issues were promptly addressed.  This protest is coming on the heels of a statement made by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno, that billions of naira meant for purchasing arms and ammunition could not be accounted for. According to the NSA, the funds were released during the time of the last set of service chiefs but the current set could not explain the whereabouts of the funds or equipment.  No less than $1 billion was released for the procurement according to Monguno, a retired Major General.
