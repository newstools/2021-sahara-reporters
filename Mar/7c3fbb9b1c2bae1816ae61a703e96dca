Hundreds of protesters on Wednesday stormed the headquarters of the Petroleum Equalisation Fund (Management) Board in Abuja to demand the sacking of its Executive Director, Ahmed Bobboi, over lopsided recruitment. The protesters, numbering over 500, vowed to take their peaceful rally to the presidential villa if their demand was not met.  They called on President Muhammadu Buhari to sack Bobboi, saying his tenure has been blighted by nepotism and blatant abuse of office. Speaking on behalf of the protesters, Coalition for Good Governance and Rule of Law President, Comrade Ikpa Isaac, faulted the recruitment exercise conducted by the agency in 2020, stating that of the 200 persons hired, only 17 persons were from the oil-rich states. According to Ikpa, this shows the insensitivity of the Executive Secretary, whom he says is not in tune with the peculiarities of the time that require creating a level playing ground for all Nigerians to actualse their dreams. Describing the action as "despicable", Ikpa noted that such is capable of setting the country on a dangerous path of disintegration. While calling on Bobboi to reverse the recruitment or resign from office, Ikpa said any inaction would see the protesters continue their peaceful rally and extend it to the office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Presidential Villa. The group further vowed to take all necessary legal actions to protect the Nigerian masses and the laws of the land.
