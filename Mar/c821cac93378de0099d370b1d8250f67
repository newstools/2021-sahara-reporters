A Nigerian man abroad simply identified as Shedrack has donated his family house as a seed to one of the branches of a popular pentecostal church in the country, Christ Embassy, also known as LoveWorld Incorporated or Believers' Love world. Shedrack was said to have returned to Nigeria last year and become more religious. The returnee reportedly sowed his car as a seed to the church in Warri, Delta State and his family members had no problem with it. LIB


He, however, went on to donate the family house to the church without the knowledge of family members who only got to know of the development recently. The family has now come out to ask for justice after Shedrack's father noticed men going around, viewing the property. When the older man made enquiry, he was told the property now belonged to Christ Embassy and had been valued to be sold at N25 million. According to reports, the house was built on land owned by the entire family and with money contributed by the whole family, though Shedrack contributed the lion's share. The house is currently being occupied by Shedrack's father, cousins and 4 tenants who paid rent. In a video posted on the Internet, Shedrack's father said he had written to the senior pastor of Christ Embassy in Warri, who promised to take action but nothing had been done about the issue after a month.
