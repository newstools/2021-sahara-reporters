The Adamawa State Police Command says it has arrested a 23-year-old man, Yusuf Jibrilla, for disrupting a wedding party. The incident occurred on Monday, March 29, in Mayo-Nguli, Maiha Local Government Area of the state.  The police accused Jibrilla of stabbing two youths, killing one.  It was gathered that the victims, Sadiq Hammadandi and Adamu Suleiman, were sitting outside the venue of the party when the suspect, said to be a drug addict, joined them to smoke his weed. The duo asked him to leave because they could not tolerate the suffocating hemp smoke but the suspect got angry, brought out a knife and stabbed them.  The victims were rushed to Maiha Cottage Hospital where Hammadandi was confirmed dead while Suleiman survived but would have to undergo surgery.
