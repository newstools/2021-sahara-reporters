Officers of the Katsina State Police Command have arrested three members of a gang of bandits/kidnappers and recovered from them a sum of N3.6 million paid to them as ransom. The command's spokesman, Gambo Isah, who disclosed this on Monday, identified the suspects as members of a notorious gang of bandits and kidnappers terrorising Katsina and Zamfara states.  "The suspects, Lawali Duna, 40, Muhammadu Lawali Babuga, 22, and Hussaini Abubakar, 30, were arrested by a police patrol team attached to Faskari Division, while on routine patrol along Funtua-Yankara Road on February 25," Isah said. "Nemesis caught up with the suspects when they were intercepted on their way back to Zamfara State from Kaduna after collecting ransom money from the relatives of a kidnapped victim. In the course of the investigation, the suspects confessed to the commission of the offence."
