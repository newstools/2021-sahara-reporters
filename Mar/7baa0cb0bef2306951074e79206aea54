The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has deepened its probe into All Progressives Congress stalwart Bola Tinubu. To this end, the EFCC has written a letter to the Code of Conduct Bureau requesting copies of Tinubu's asset declaration form.  A copy of the letter, which was published by an online news medium, The Peoples Gazette, revealed that the investigation into Tinubu began last year after the removal of erstwhile Chairman Ibrahim Magu.The letter marked CR/3000/EFCC/LS/Vol4/322, dated November 6, 2020, was signed by the then Lagos zonal head, Abdulrasheed Bawa, who is now the Chairman of the EFCC.The letter read in part, "In view of the above, you are kindly requested to furnish the commission with the outstanding requested information of Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu."This request is made pursuant to Section 38(1) and (2) of the EFCC Act 2004."Attempts to speak with the EFCC Spokesman, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, proved abortive as he did not respond to calls.However, a senior EFCC official confirmed the letter's authenticity, adding that it was part of a broader probe, Punch reports.The official, who wished to remain anonymous, said the probe was a sequel to some petitions written against Tinubu since 2018, which Magu had failed to act on.The source said, "The letter is authentic. The EFCC receives several petitions against Tinubu, including one involving alleged fraud in Alpha Beta Consulting."Apara had also instituted a lawsuit against Tinubu.In his statement of claim, he stated that Tinubu controlled the company, receiving 10 per cent of the taxes collected on behalf of the state.As the head of the company, the former MD began looking into its finances and made many startling discoveries, such as mysterious transfers of over N20bn to various companies.He stated, "N550m payment to Ocean Trust Ltd vide payment instruction dated the 15/5/18, N850m payment to Ocean Trust Ltd vide payment instruction dated the 14/3/15."The claimant said N960m was spent on purchasing HITV's 300,000,000 shares.However, Alpha Beta Tax consultancy firm, Alpha Beta LLP, denied allegations levelled against it by Apara, adding that he had diverted about $5m during his time as managing director by inflating a contract which was worth about $300,000 and then diverted a separate N6bn to personal use.
