The son of the former PSG player is accused of having organised several noisy parties at his home in Saint-Germain-en-Laye since the first confinement in France, which began on the 17th of March 2020. The 33-year-old invoked his diplomatic passport and immunity every time the police intervened. Weah Jr had been arrested by police in February for breaking coronavirus rules during a party in the Alma-Marceau neighbourhood of the French capital. Le Parisien newspaper reported that Weah Jr was questioned by detectives in relation to charges of disturbing the peace. The 33-year-old son of Liberia’s president reportedly claimed diplomatic immunity when police arrived at the property following noise complaints. He was arrested for insulting the police and resisting arrest, and then later released. The French press has reported on how his neighbours in the Paris suburb of Saint-Germain-en-Laye complain about his regular parties. Being brought into custody suggests that Weah Jr will not be afforded diplomatic immunity, although the French public prosecutor has not confirmed this despite repeated requests from RFI.
