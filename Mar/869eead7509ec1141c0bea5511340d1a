Gunmen suspected to bandits have released three videos showing 39 students abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation in Afaka, Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna state, begging the state government to facilitate their release. The criminals are reportedly demanding N500 million to release the victims.  SaharaReporters had reported how bandits broke into the school on Thursday night and abducted some students. Using the abducted student's Facebook accounts, the gunmen released three videos showing them surrounded by gunmen in military uniform flogging them. The bandits also displayed their arsenal of weapons in the video in a show of strength, threatening to eliminate their hostages if the government fails to pay the ransom or tries to secure their release by force. â€œMy name is Abubakar Yakubu. A student of Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation Kaduna. I am appealing to the Governor of Kaduna State, the state government and the Federal government," one of them said in the videos. Another abducted student appealed to the Nigerian government to come to their rescue by paying the N500 million demanded by their abductors. She stated: "Please, we need your help; they are asking for N500 million."
