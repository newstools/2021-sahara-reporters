The President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Samson Ayokunle, has condemned Nigerian government's inability to complete the 200km Abuja-Lokoja highway that has been under construction since 15 years ago, describing it as 'a shame of a nation'. Ayokunle disclosed this in Lokoja, Kogi State, on Monday, at the official inauguration of the Government House chapel for Christian worshippers built by the present administration of Governor Yahaya Bello.  He said the indifference of the government towards the construction of the Abuja-Lokoja highway remains a sore thumb for various leaderships at the federal level. Ayokunle noted that until the nation's leaders imbibe the spirit of sincerity and fear of God, the country may not receive the desired change. “Lokoja-Abuja highway is a shame of the country. Do something and remove this shame, 15 years constructing a 200km road is a shame,” he said. According to him, Nigeria is a complex nation with people from different ethnic, religious and socio-cultural backgrounds, endowed with human and material resources, which if properly harnessed, would join the comity of great states, and dust off the present hardship that has bedevilled it. He noted that for the country to be great, there is a need for justice, fairness and mutual respect for one and another in all segments in the society. The CAN president who described the present generation of people in the country as sophisticatedly educated hinted that it was no longer easy to use an old trick to deceive people and get away with it. “While practising democracy, let us use our native wisdom. Where you are included, you see government as your own, and where you are excluded, you agitate to right the wrongs. We need justice, fairness and mutual respect in Nigeria,” he added.
