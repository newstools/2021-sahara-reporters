The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, (ICPC) has arraigned the former Provost, Federal College of Education (Technical), Asaba, Ezoem Nwanze Ignatius, and a former Director of Works in the institution, Chukwuka Jonas Ifechukwude, as well as the registrar, Ugbeche Linus Ifeanyi, before the Federal High Court, Asaba, over charges bordering on corruption and fraudulent acts. The arraignment followed a petition sent to the ICPC by a whistle-blower and the Head of Physical Planning Division of Works and Services Department of the college, Joseph Ameh, over a series of corrupt practices in the institution allegedly involving the incumbent Provost, Josephine Anene-Okakwa, acting Director of Works, Ibhafidon Ehimen, with the support of members of the governing council of the institution.  Ameh, who was sacked last year by the institution following some petitions to the commission, had alleged that there were threats on his life, among others. "It became obvious that the threat to terminate my appointment for daring to speak against unprofessional, unsafe practices and deep-rooted corruption and sharp practices by the management and the governing council ally, Mr. Femi Ibrahim could not coerce me to yield to the decision to grant further illegal variations and payments outside contract conditions proposed in the meeting where the contractor has been overpaid by over N70 million that has been shared by the management and governing council ally," he said. Ameh had also revealed among other things the variation and overpayment by the former director of works, Chukwuka Jonas Ifechukwude, Anene-Okakwa and governing council chairman, Ibrahim Olufemi, to Davoris Nigeria Limited for the construction of an administrative block at the college, amongst other projects. There were also allegations of a plot to override outstanding and defective works and make payments outside architects verified works and costing instructions to the QS Yahaya Gwani on a block of 12 classrooms constructed by Shull Point Ventures. The petitioner had further noted that â€œOver the years, fraud and financial improprieties have been going on as a routine and I have suffered all manners of official, psychological and physical intimidation for daring to speak out to the extent that in anticipation of my reactions, I have been labelled a petition writer, queried, threatened to be sacked and warned not to speak out against all these improprieties. This has also come to pass with my termination letter just received," he said. The Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) on 11 February, 2021 arraigned the former Provost, FCET, Asaba, Ezoem Nwanze Ignatius, former Director of works, Chukwuka Jonas Ifechukwude, and the institution's registrar, Ugbeche Linus Ifeanyi on 6 counts bordering on corruption and fraudulent acts at the Federal High Court, Asaba.
