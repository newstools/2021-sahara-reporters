Boko Haram terrorists have pulled out of the ancient town of Dikwa in Borno State after being in control for hours and killing five soldiers, military sources told SaharaReporters. Dikwa town is about 90km from Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, and has experienced several attacks from the insurgents since the liberation of the town in 2016.  SaharaReporters had earlier reported how the militant group on Monday night dislodged Nigerian troops in the community, and while most of the villagers ran away for safety, some were held by the insurgents.
