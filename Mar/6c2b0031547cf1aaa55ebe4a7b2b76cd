We took him to court, and the court decided he should be remanded,” the Commissioner of Police in Bayelsa State, Mike Okoli, said.“Where he is remanded is the decision of the court; we are no longer detaining him; he is now before the court. Where he is to be kept is at the discretion of the court.”Idumange said he had filed a complaint with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission against Governor Duoye Diri’s administration.Diri had on Monday dismissed his allegations as a ploy to blackmail and arm-twist his administration to give appointments.“Let me say it clearly before the full glare of the press that we are open to criticism if they are constructive, but this one is entirely not based on facts; the funds are being managed by CBN and warehoused at Access bank.“The N3 billion is not in the treasury of Bayelsa government to be disbursed, and the CBN has come here to say that no funds are missing,” the governor had said.
