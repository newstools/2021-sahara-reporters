The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the University of Benin (UNIBEN), Dr Benedicta Ehanire, has verbally attacked a student of the institution for speaking against the suspension of the students’ union by the Professor Lilian Salami-led management. SaharaReporters gathered that the student had posted his opinion on a WhatsApp group where some senior university staff members and students belong.  Not satisfied with the student’s opinion, Ehanire messaged him privately, hurling insults at him. “God punish you, A complete fool you are, if not UNIBEN, are you up to my guard at home? It is clear you lack home training,” the university PRO said.  Ehanire however refused to comment on the matter and blocked the number used in contacting her by SaharaReporters. Students of the institution had on Tuesday evening trooped out in their numbers to protest against the suspension of the students’ union. The students also resisted an attempt to be evacuated from their halls of residence. The institution's Senate on Tuesday rose from a meeting to suspend the executives of the students’ union body, saying it was to forestall the breakdown of law and order. Chanting ‘No SUG! No UNIBEN! We are not going nowhere’, the students said the management wanted to use the hostel accommodations of the school to host athletes coming for the National Sports Festival holding in Benin City, the state capital on April 4. Comrade Destiny Uanzekin, Public Relations Officer of the students’ Union, described the evacuation order as a violation of students’ academic rights. He also condemned the proscription of the students' union.
