Miyetti Allah Breeders Association of Nigeria says it is tired of open grazing in Ondo State. It called on the government to make provision for ranches as a way of putting an end to frequent herdsmen/farmers' crises. Ondo Governor Rotimi Akeredolu The Chairman of the association in the state, Alhaji Bello Garba, stated this on Wednesday in Akure. Garba was speaking during a public hearing on a bill to regulate rearing and grazing of livestock and provide for the establishment of ranches and other related matters. He said that the association would support any peaceful move to address the issue in the state, adding that farmers and herdsmen must carry out their respective activities without clashing. According to him, the association has been begging the state government to register Fulani men in all the state's local government area. Similarly, Mr Ibrahim Abdul-Rahman, the Assistant Secretary of the state's association, explained that open grazing had become obsolete and needed to be banned.

Applauding the move, Mr Gbenga Obaweya, the Chairman of Ondo State Agricultural Commodities Association (OSACA), said that it was a step in the right direction. Obaweya noted that the state government's body language showed that it was ready to protect agriculture and agricultural practices and put an end to the lingering clashes between farmers and herdsmen.
