A former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido, has said Nigeria is now more divided under the All Progressives Congress-led government. Lamido, who spoke at the commissioning of Rumuji-Ibaa-Obele-Isiokpo Road in the Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State on Monday said it has been all confusion and crises in the last five years. Sule Lamido He said: “In the last five years of APC in government, Nigeria has become more divided. There is more hate and disunity between North and South, East and West, Muslim and Christians even and ever, there are bigger and micro problems. From top to bottom, it is all confusion and crisis." Lamido also urged the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike to keep working with other governors to restore trust in Nigeria. He said: “Please, keep on inviting your people…even APC, call them here because only a leader like you and governors seem to be working together to restore trust in Nigeria. “So, please invite them, let them come. When we see you calling people, they come here and go back to their areas. This means there is hope in Nigeria. “APC has disintegrated. There is no single job anywhere either in the North or South. What do you hear from any Nigerian president from the north? Nothing. So, to ask: is the Nigerian president for the Nigerian people? “Nigerian people are both in the North, in the South. They are Igbos, Yorubas or Hausa, or Fulani. They are also Christians, they are also Muslims, so which means it is our common humanity which should be uniting us.”
