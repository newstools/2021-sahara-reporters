Therefore, the perpetrators of this despicable act should remember that there will be consequences for all actions because the blood of the dead will surely speak and fight back.  “To the police in Ekiti, they know what to do and the people behind all these, if only they chose not to look away. Ekiti shall be free again if we collectively confront and win this battle against fake apostles of democracy.”  At least three people, including a female police officer, were killed in the violence unleashed on voters and security agents during the by-election for Ekiti East Constituency 1 in the State House of Assembly.
