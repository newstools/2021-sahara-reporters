A combined team of security operatives have arrested some members of the African Alliance Congress who arrived at the headquarters of Independent National Electoral Commission to protest the commission’s alleged interference and imposition of expelled member, Leonard Ezenwa, on the party. SaharaReporters learnt that armed security operatives including the police, operatives of the Department of State Services and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps were stationed at the entrance of the building to frustrate the protesters.  Five of the protesters were thereafter rounded up and arrested upon their arrival. They were whisked away into a building of the commission. It was also learnt that some members of the party in a bus were harassed and sent away by the gun-wielding security operatives. Members of the party had two weeks ago given the electoral body till March 15 to stop meddling in the affairs of the party. They had asked the INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, to return the party to the original owners. The former Presidential candidate of the party, Omoyele Sowore, who had led members of the party to the commission, had condemned Mahmood’s action for foistering Ezenwa on the party as Chairman with a view to destabilising and creating confusion in the party. He had said the party would mobilise and direct all its members at the expiration of the ultimatum to occupy and shut down all the offices of the commission across the country. He faulted the partisan role played by the commission by giving illegal recognition to Ezenwa.
