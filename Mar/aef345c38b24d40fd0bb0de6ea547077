A human rights activist and convener of Concerned Nigerians Group, Deji Adeyanju has called on the Nigeria Police to arrest the Chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, Danladi Umar for assaulting a security guard in Abuja. Adeyanju made the call through a press release made available to SaharaReporters on Wednesday. Danladi Umar SaharaReporters had earlier reported that the CCT boss, Umar, and his driver brutalised a security guard at Banex plaza at Wuse 2 in Abuja on Monday. Umar was seen in a viral video assaulting the security man. Many of the eyewitnesses condemned the assault and called for justice.  Reacting to this, Adeyanju in the statement said, “The attention of Concerned Nigerians for the protection of Human Rights and Rule of Law Initiative has been drawn to a press statement by the Code of Conduct Tribunal Chairman, Danladi Umar, denying the assault he unleashed on an innocent Nigerian carrying out his duty at the Banex Plaza, Wuse 2 Abuja. “We are surprised that the CCT chairman will blatantly deny a viral video that was captured by many witnesses. The violent attack on the private security guard is distasteful and should be condemned by all and sundry.” See Also

1 Day Ago Adeyanju went further to condemn the despicable act of Umar’s spokesman who resorted to ethnic profiling during the statement he issued. “We are also deeply concerned that in an attempt to exonerate Mr. Umar Danladi of wrongdoing, the spokesman for the Bureau resorted to ethnic profiling by referring to concerned Nigerians who rose to the defence of the security guard that was being assaulted as 'Biafran thugs.' “Consequently, we are calling on the police to arrest and prosecute the chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, Danladi Umar, who allegedly assaulted the Nigerian citizen in the viral video. “The masses are already being tormented by the economic hardship, therefore; being assaulted by Danladi is the peak of all physical assaults. “Political leaders are supposed to safeguard and protect the well-being of all Nigerians but not the other way round. On this basis, Danladi Umar needs to face the full wrath of the law and bear the consequences of his action. “The police need to demonstrate that the Nigerian constitution is no respecter of any person or group of persons.” See Also
