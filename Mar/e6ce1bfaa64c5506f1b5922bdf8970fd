Militants from the Islamic State backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād, have allegedly killed 30 Nigerian soldiers in Borno state. According to ISWAP in a statement released on Tuesday, the soldiers were killed when two explosive-laden vehicles rammed into a military convoy in Wulgo. ISWAP Soldiers The suicide bombers were identified as Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and Bana Jundullah. The group also claimed four military vehicles were destroyed. The claim by ISWAP comes few hours after troops of the Special Forces Brigade engaged the insurgents in a gun battle at Chikingudu, a community in Marte Local Government Area. According to a military signal seen by SaharaReporters, seven soldiers also sustained injuries during the clash. About 25 AK-47 rifles, three anti-aircraft guns, three general purpose machine guns, two automatic grenade launchers (AGL), and two gun trucks, among other ammunition, were also recovered by troops. ISWAP, which split from the mainstream Boko Haram in 2016, has become a dominant group, focusing on military targets and high-profile attacks, including against aid workers. The Nigerian army has repeatedly claimed that the insurgency has been largely defeated and frequently underplays any losses. The terror group has caused over 40,000 deaths and displaced millions of individuals mainly in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states.
