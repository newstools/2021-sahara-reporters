A young man has allegedly been killed by suspected bandits in Zamfara State while trying to stop the gunmen from raping his wife on their wedding night. It was gathered that the incident happened in Gwashi town, Bukkuyum Local Government Area in the state. Burial of man who died protecting wife from rape A Twitter user, Yusuf Anka on Tuesday shared photos from the funeral of the young man. "The remains of a newly-wedded young man being laid to rest in Gwashi... He was killed by bandits while protecting his newly-wedded wife from being raped by the bandits on her first day in her matrimonial home,” Yusuf wrote. A resident of Zamfara also confirmed the incident to SaharaReporters. “Yes, the story is true. He was killed by bandits who tried to rape his wife,” he said. Zamfara, like other North-West states, has in the last 10 years faced devastating attacks from armed bandits. In 2019, the state government entered a peace agreement with the gunmen. But despite all these, communities in the state are still being attacked and residents kidnapped and/or killed. About 15 brand new Hilux vehicles and cash gifts were also given to leaders of different 'repentant' banditry groups by the governor in 2020. A top military officer recently told SaharaReporters that the bandits were carrying out attacks with some of the vehicles given to them by Matawalle. The officer had said, “Those bandits have different groups, so if they say they repent, the governor will give them a Hilux vehicle but unfortunately they are now using the vehicles to carry out attacks. “Like yesterday (Monday), they attacked Jankara but were resisted by the local vigilantes, so they fled and left one of those Hilux vehicles and the motorcycles they came with behind. “It’s so sad, he called it a peace and reconciliation programme, but all you need to be rich now in Zamfara is to take up arms against the people.”
