File photo used to illustrate story. It was gathered that it had become habitual for robbers to waylay motorists on the road without being challenged by security operatives. Victims on Wednesday shared videos of the incident, lamenting that the Lagos State Government had neglected the security of lives and property in the Ajah area, which is notorious for traffic robbers. A woman, Enitioluwafe, who made a video, said, “This happened on Ado road heading to Ajah this morning. Due to the traffic caused by trucks which are packed on the road, people were robbed and maimed.” Another witness, Joseph Olawumi, said, “Guns kill faster than COVID-19. The only vaccine against criminals bedevilling Ado-Badore Road in Ajah is adequate security and removal of the trucks causing traffic on the road. Please do something, sir (referring to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu).” Another road user said, “You all need to do something about Ajah road. This is the third time they are robbing this week on Ado road because tippers are packed, causing traffic and creating avenue for this. This nonsense has to stop.”
