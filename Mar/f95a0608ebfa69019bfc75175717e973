Gunmen suspected to be bandits have abducted the daughter of an operative of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), identified as Alhaji Faruk in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi state. A resident told SaharaReporters that the incident happened in the early hours of Thursday.  He said the gunmen invaded Faruk’s residence, whisked away his daughter after shooting sporadically. He added that a yet-to-be identified woman was hit by a stray bullet in her leg “The entire area was thrown into a state of pandemonium because of the sporadic gunshots,” a source told SaharaReporters. Kebbi, like other North-West states, has in the last few years faced devastating attacks from armed bandits and kidnappers.  Do you have a story for us? Please use this FORM.
