Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, has advised Nigerians in the United Kingdom to occupy the London hospital where President Muhammadu Buhari plans to have a medical checkup. Femi Adesina, a media aide to Buhari, had on Tuesday revealed that the president will leave Nigeria for the United Kingdom for “routine medical leave” on Wednesday. Omoyele Sowore

The human rights activist also advised Nigerians in the UK to occupy the Abuja House in London. He wrote on Twitter: “Nigerians in the UK must #occupy the hospital where sickly @mbuhari is wasting Nigeria’s resources and the Nigeria embassy as well as Abuja House in London, let Buhari return home and do a medical check in the 'world-class' hospital he built since coming to power. #Buharimustgo!” Nigerians in UK must #occupy the hospital where sickly @mbuhari is wasting Nigeriaâs resources and the Nigeria embassy as well as Abuja Hiuse in London, let Buhari return home and do a medical check in the âworld classâ hospital he built since coming to power. #Buharimustgo!  Adesina in his statement said Buhari was expected back in the country in the second week of April 2021. The news of the president's medical trip comes just as the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors on Monday insisted on embarking on a nationwide strike on Thursday. The association had based its decision on what it described as the Nigerian government’s insincerity in implementing agreements.
