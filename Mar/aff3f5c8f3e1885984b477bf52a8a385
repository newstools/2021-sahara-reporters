The return of Nigeria’s First Lady, Aisha Buhari, to Aso Rock Villa from the United Arab Emirates last Thursday was partly due to the ailment of a top member of the cabal in President Muhammadu Buhari’s government, Mamman Daura. Daura has long been viewed as the leader of a powerful cabal or 'powerful kitchen cabinet' alleged to have hijacked the Buhari presidency since he came to power.  SaharaReporters learnt from Presidency sources that 81-year-old Daura, who is Buhari’s nephew, is now partially paralysed on the left side and managing his health presently in Kaduna. SaharaReporters further gathered that the First Lady returned to the country, believing that Aso Villa was more secure with Daura out of the way and managing his health away from the State House. It was also learnt that with Daura out of Aso Villa and less active, the power tussle in the Villa would be reduced and the place would be more conducive for her, although she still has a young man, Sabiu, alias Tunde “Idiagbon” to contend with. Aisha returned last Thursday after spending about six months in the UAE. Buhari reportedly made her last known public appearance in September 2020 during the wedding of her daughter, Hanan.
