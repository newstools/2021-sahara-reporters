There was a mild drama at the Wuse, Zone 2 Magistrate Court Abuja on Tuesday as a traditional spiritual leader dressed in full regalia accompanied human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore in solidarity. The traditionalist was seen waving his horsewhip and gourd in the air while chanting ahead of the commencement of trial.  Court workers, journalists, policemen, and other visitors who were on the court premises were stunned by the development, while others burst into laughter. As of the time of filing this report, supporters of the activist were chanting anti-government songs in front of the court. Sowore was arrested alongside four others on New Year's Eve for organising a candlelight procession and charged for alleged criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, and inciting public disturbance.
