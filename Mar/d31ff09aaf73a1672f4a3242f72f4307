Gunmen suspected to be armed bandits have attacked Kabasa village in Magami District, Gusau Local Government Area of Zamfara state, killing eight persons, including three soldiers. SaharaReporters gathered that the bandits, armed with sophisticated weapons, stormed the village on Tuesday evening and started shooting indiscriminately.  A resident said the soldiers were ambushed on their way to restore peace at Kabasa after some gunmen had invaded the community. He added that the gunmen burnt a military operational vehicle and stole cows and farm produce. “Eight people were killed by bandits yesterday, three soldiers and five civilians. Some soldiers were also injured by the gunmen,” a source told SaharaReporters. The incident comes a few days after different attacks on six villages by bandits left scores of villagers killed in the state.  According to Jamilu Magaji, press secretary to Governor Bello Matawalle, the attacks were carried out in two local government areas (LGAs) of the state. Villages where scores of people were killed by the bandits included Damaga, Jihiya, Shandame, Gidan Runji and Daki Hudu, all in Maradun Local Government Area, while the sixth village that came under attack was Kizara in Tsafe LGA. Deadly attacks have raged across Zamfara state where bandits have thrived. Farming and herding communities in the state have long been terrorised by gangs who raid villages, steal cattle and kidnap residents for ransom. In 2019, the state government entered a peace agreement with the gunmen. About 15 brand new Hilux vehicles and cash gifts were also given to leaders of different 'repentant' gangs of bandits by the governor in 2020. But despite all these, communities in the state are still being attacked and residents kidnapped and/or killed.
