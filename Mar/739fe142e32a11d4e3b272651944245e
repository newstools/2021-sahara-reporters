The players are camped at the Eko Hotels and Suites and will begin training Tuesday (today) at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos, ahead of the build-up to their games billed for Saturday and Tuesday next week. The Eagles top Group L with eight points from four games. Enyimba goalkeeper John Noble was on the initial 24-man list for both games, but his teammate Anayo Iwuala and Abia Warriors’ centre-back Adekunle Adeleke were handed invitations from the domestic league, following the withdrawals of some Europe-based players from the squad.
