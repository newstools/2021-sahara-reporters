He explained that Customs officials had entered the bush where the bandits were taking shelter, describing it as the same route used by smugglers to bring contraband into the country. “We (the operatives) seized 37 bags of rice and the bandits asked for seven bags before allowing them to pass and save their lives. “So, you see the risk we take but people, especially those living along the border communities engaged in attacking our officers,” he said. The comptroller noted that the sector has intercepted contraband with a duty-paid value of over N304,325,850.90 and arrested four smugglers in Katsina state from February 1 to date.
