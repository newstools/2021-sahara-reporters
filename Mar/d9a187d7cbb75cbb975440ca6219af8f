Several countries have suspended AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines amid rising fears over blood clots and other possible side effects. AstraZeneca, an Anglo-Swedish company that developed the vaccine with Oxford University, has insisted that there is no risk.  On March 11, Denmark said it would suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine as a precautionary measure over fears of blood clots in vaccinated people. Iceland and Norway followed suit on the same day, temporarily suspending the use of all the supply of the vaccine, citing similar concerns. Bulgaria suspended the use of the vaccine on March 12 as it investigates the death of a woman with several underlying conditions who received the jab in the past week. An initial probe suggested the woman died from heart failure and an autopsy found no link with the vaccination. See Also

On March 8, Austria announced that it had stopped administering a batch of the vaccine following the death of a 49-year-old nurse from “severe bleeding disorders” days after receiving it. Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Luxembourg also suspended the use of doses from the same batch, which has been delivered to 17 countries and included one million vaccines. Italy’s medicines regulator on March 11 also banned the use of a batch as a precaution, triggering a similar decision from Romania. And on Sunday, Italy’s northern Piedmont region suspended use of the vaccine after the death of a teacher who had received it the day before. Amidst the suspensions, the Nigerian government said the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine it received was not part of the batch allegedly causing a blood clot in some countries in Europe. President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, some state governors and front-line health workers have received shots of the vaccine. See Also
