Several parts of Abuja have been grappling with insecurity challenges ranging from kidnapping for ransom to armed robbery and carjacking. Two days ago, gunmen attacked a pregnant woman during a midnight raid on Kwaita community in the Kwali Area Council. Sources said during the raid, the kidnappers also abducted three persons, including the woman’s husband. The kidnappers invaded the houses of their victims and whisked them away after shooting sporadically. The incident comes barely a month after gunmen abducted a PUNCH journalist, Okechukwu Nnodim, at his house in the Arab Road area of Kubwa. The kidnappers also attacked his neighbours and went away with the two sons of a widow, Mrs Faith Gbeyide.
