Bayero University Kano “They told us any guy and girl found together in a room will henceforth be fined N20, 000 each. Warning us to stay away from all immoral acts,” a student said. SaharaReporters had earlier reported how operatives of the Islamic police invaded some off-campus hostels of the university, arresting students of the opposite sex found in the same room. It was learnt that Hisbah officials broke into the students’ rooms and took them to their office. A source said the operation by the state religious body sparked off tension in the neighborhood as other students kept vigil all through the night out of fear of the unknown. Despite condemnation from Nigerians, Hisbah group has continued its push for Islamic agenda in the North.
