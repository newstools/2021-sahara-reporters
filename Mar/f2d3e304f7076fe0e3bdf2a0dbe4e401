The United Kingdom has signed a Memorandum of Understanding to return the sum of £4.2 million of stolen assets stolen by ex-Delta State Governor, James Ibori. This was announced on Tuesday by the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing in Abuja, the nation’s capital. James Ibori According to Channels TV, Laing stated this at the signing of the MoU at the Conference Hall of the Ministry of Justice. She said the money was recovered from friends and family members of the former governor. She frowned that many Nigerians were in the habit of siphoning money from the country to the UK, saying that has also affected the level of trust between the two countries. Laing however warned that the UK will no longer be used as a destination for looters to siphon proceeds of crimes. The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami said the recovery of the stolen fund is part of the efforts of the current administration to fight corruption. He said that the money will be used for the construction of the second Niger Bridge, Abuja-Kano Road, and Lagos-Ibadan Express Road.
