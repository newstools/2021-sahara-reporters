At least 15 people were killed while over 100 people were abducted. They were shooting sporadically, they did not even spare any one, including women, nursing mothers and children. They herded them into bush,” the source said. Sokoto is one of the most terrorised Northwest states in Nigeria. Its residents have been severely troubled by bandits and kidnappers.
