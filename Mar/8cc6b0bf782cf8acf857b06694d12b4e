The Katsina State Police Command has arrested three persons for posing as spirits (Aljannu) to defraud people. The police disclosed this in a statement signed by its spokesperson, Gambo Isah.  Isah identified the men as Usman Adamu, 40; Abba Ibrahim, 38; and Abdurrauf Iliyasu, 39. The statement read, “Nemesis caught up with them when they called a woman, Jamila Sulaiman, on her phone that they were spirits (Aljannu), and directed her to go to the outskirts of Yar-Gamji village and drop the sum of N150,000 or risk her parents or children being killed by spirits. “The victim, out of fear, took the money to the location and dropped it. Furthermore, she transferred another N97,000 into the hoodlums’ bank account. “In the course of investigation, the suspects were trailed and arrested and they confessed to the crime and other similar offences. Investigation is ongoing.” Earlier in January, the command announced the arrest of Kabiru Bashir and Sadiq Ashiru for posing as evil spirits to defraud people in the state. The suspects were allegedly arrested after they stole the ATM card of one Rabi’atu Garba and told her they were spirits, asking her to give them her PIN.
