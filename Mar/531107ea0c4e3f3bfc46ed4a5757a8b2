The Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Ahmed Audi, has said that bandits in the country have international sponsors. The CG, while speaking at a training workshop for state commandants of the NSCDC in Abuja on Wednesday, stated that the asymmetric war witnessed in the country needs collaboration among security agencies.  He warned against rivalry and service supremacy among security agencies as this might hinder success in the fight against banditry. Audi said, “Following how events are unfolding in the country, we are experiencing a serious conflict that I think in the history of Nigeria, this is about the first conflict that will give us a serious problem and the conflict is called asymmetric war. “We have had in the past some semblance of this type of war but the proper manifestation of it is the one we are seeing now and asymmetric war is a war that requires all hands to be on deck if we really want to deal with it and nip it in the bud. “These guys are serious; these guys have international sponsors, so we need to come together. “Civil defence will do our best to make sure that these security incidences are curbed and totally eliminated."
