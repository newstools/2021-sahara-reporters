A Catholic priest, Reverend Father Anthony Dawah has been kidnapped in Kaduna State.  SaharaReporters learnt that Dawah was kidnapped together with his catechist, the catechistâ€™s wife and a few other members of his church.  This comes barely two weeks after a parish priest, Reverend Father John Bako Shekwolo of St. Theresa Catholic Church, Ankwa in the Kachia Local Government Area was kidnapped in same state.  Last week, some members of the Redeemed Christian Church of God were kidnapped in the state.  A source told SaharaReporters that the victims were kidnapped while travelling out of the state.  "The priest along with his catechist have just been abducted. The kidnappers have taken them out of town. I guess they were leaving the town when they abducted them. Christians are no more safe in this country," he said.
