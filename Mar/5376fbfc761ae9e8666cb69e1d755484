A member of staff of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Fisayo Oyeniyi, hung himself in his residence after sending suicide text to his mother, wife and children. The Nation reports that Oyeniyi, one of the armed guards in the security department, left his workplace around Kanmi bus stop at Ifewara road, Ile-Ife, to commit suicide.  Oyeniyi sent text messages to his mother, wife and his two children, informing them that he was not interested in living again. A source in the area named Tolani said, "The incident happened around noon. I saw people rushing to his apartment to get to see for themselves to be sure of what Mr. Oyeniyi has done to himself.
