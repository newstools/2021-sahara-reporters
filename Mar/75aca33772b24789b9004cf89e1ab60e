Khadijat Mohammed, wife of Abdullahi Bhuwa Usman, a soldier who was killed by Boko Haram terrorists, has described him as a patriotic officer of the Nigerian Army. Usman, who recently got married to Khadijat, was among the soldiers killed on January 29 when the insurgents engaged the Nigerian military in a four-hour battle to take control of Dikwa.  The gun battle started around 6:00 pm and lasted till about 10:00 pm. It claimed many casualties, including Usman’s. A family source had told SaharaReporters that the deceased got married in December 2020 and was looking forward to raising a family when the tragic incident occurred. “I received the news of Usman's death with deep shock. He just got married on December 27, 2020. I attended the wedding here in Lagos,” the source had said. "Though he wasn't in attendance physically (at the wedding) because he was on duty, his family members and friends were all here and left with the wife for Borno State that same day.”Khadijat told SaharaReporters Speaking to SaharaReporters, Khadijat said her late husband served the nation with dedication and commitment and paid the supreme price by laying down his life for the peace of the country. The widow said Usman told her several times that a day would come when he would not return home to her. “Some soldiers are into this work with their own heart because anytime my husband was leaving the house then, I would ask him when next he would be coming back home and he always taunted me, asking who gave me the assurance that he would come back. He said I would surely get the news of his death one day. “I know I got married to him for just a month and some days but the way he was talking about death was somehow. He was into the job to help people, not to make money,” she told SaharaReporters. Khadijat described her late husband as a gentle and hard-working officer.
