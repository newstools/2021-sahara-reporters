They arrested a lot of people. So the women felt why should you be arresting our young ones when in reality, when the Fulani herdsmen come to attack us, you are no where to be found but when our people mobilise to go after them, you now come to pick them. “So the women told the men, we don’t want any man to join us, they now took to the street. The military now blocked the road and started shooting, in the process, they kill one woman and injure many others,” the source told SaharaReporters. Hundreds of people have been killed by suspected Fulani herdsmen in various local government Areas of Southern Kaduna in the past couple of years. The killings have continued despite the deployment of various military teams to the area.
