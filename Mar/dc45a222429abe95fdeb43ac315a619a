The Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) Worldwide, has condemned the assassination attempt on its National Treasurer, Comrade Timilaemi Ebifoubo, and the killing of his uncle, Mr. Omolojo Etolo. According to the group, the attack was carried out by some gunmen on March 6, in his community, Amabulou in Ekeremor Local Government Area.  A statement issued by its National Spokesperson, Ebilade Ekerefe, said the council frowned on the unfortunate incident and therefore called on the Nigeria Police and other relevant security agencies to swing into action and arrest the culprits. Ekerefe in the statement noted that available information suggested that the criminal gang was holding the entire community hostage. This, according to him, has degenerated into looting and destruction of properties. He said the people of Amabulou were living in fear because of the poor security situation. According to Ekerefe, there is now a complete breakdown of law and order in the community which should not be tolerated considering its rich cultural and traditional importance. The council added that if steps were not taken urgently to bring normalcy to the community, the problem could spiral and get out of control. It also called on the Bayelsa State government to intervene and bring normalcy back to the once peaceful community.
