A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Dr Muiz Banire, has made a case for including judicial officers in government lists for the first set of Nigerians to be vaccinated against COVID-19. He stated that judges were a high-risk group for catching the virus because they daily interact with the public in the course of their work.  Banire, a former National Legal Adviser of the All Progressive Congress and a former Chairman of the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria, observed that the judiciary seems to have been ignored, despite being the third arm of government. Banire said, “Please remember our judges. In several of my columns, I have practically begged for the recognition of judges in the scheme of things in Nigeria, particularly in terms of their welfare. “Regrettably, it does not appear that the executive and the legislators at all levels still appreciate the fact that the judiciary remains the third arm of government in Nigeria that deserves the recognition. “This time I am alerting the consciousness of the various committees and the task force responsible for the COVID-19 vaccination to rank judges amongst the first line of beneficiaries. “As we all know, these are gentlemen who daily interact with stakeholders in the administration of justice and are often exposed to the pandemic. I sincerely plead that they be urgently included in the first set of those to be vaccinated. I do plead.”
