The Kaduna State Government has said that bandits killed no fewer than 937 people in the state in 2020. The state's Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, disclosed this on Wednesday. Kaduna State Governor Nasiru Ahmed El-Rufai Aruwan, who made a presentation of the 2020 security report before traditional rulers, members of the civil society organisations, and the media at the Government House in Kaduna, said that despite the challenges, the government, in collaboration with security agencies, was working hard to bring the problem to an end. Aruwan said the Igabi Local Government Area of the state had the highest figures of 152 deaths, followed by the Zango Kataf local government with 114 deaths. In Kaduna, bandits' activities have crippled socio-economic activities in more than seven local government areas of the state â€“ Igabi, Giwa, Chikun, Zango Kataf, Zaria, Kajuru, Kaura and Jemaa. Apart from affecting livelihood, the security problem has also claimed several lives. Many sustained permanent injuries while hundreds of others became internally displaced.
