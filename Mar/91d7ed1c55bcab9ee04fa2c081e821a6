I know that the recruitment process took into consideration people who are from that immediate corridor, who know the terrain very well, that is the principle of Amotekun. “We are not going to include someone to work in Amotekun in Oja Odan, who is from Ado-Odo-Ota: all those that will work in the corridor are those who know the area very well,” he said.
