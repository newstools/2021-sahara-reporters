The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Akure, Ondo State, Pastor Adewale Giwa, has said that he will rather die than allow himself to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus. The pastor-cum-social critic in a release on Wednesday added that he had advised his church members, family and friends not to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Pastor Adewale Giwa In the release sent to Daily Post, the cleric stated that any pastor in the country who allows his church members to be vaccinated is short-sighted. The pastor said, “There is a difference between a religious leader and a spiritual leader. You can have a master’s degree in Theology, and as well be a leader in the church without being led by the Holy Spirit. Anybody who is biblically sound can also wake up today to become a religious leader recognised by a religious body or by the government. “However, spiritual leadership comprises three principal components: vision, hope and faith. A spiritual leader rules, guides and inspires others. To me, those asking their members to take COVID-19 vaccines are short-sighted religious leaders who are not led by the Holy Spirit. “Our God is omnipotent, omniscient; He is the Alpha and Omega. You don’t have more power than your creator. How can you neglect God for a vaccine? “After being vaccinated, you still have to keep all rules relating to the disease and all that. Let me repeat again that Nigeria needs Jesus Christ, not a vaccine. “As for me, you would kill me than allow myself to be vaccinated. Those who need it can take it, but as for me, members, families and loved ones, Jesus Christ is our strength. “I will maintain my position in doing what is right by God till Jesus Christ comes. Nobody can discourage or frighten me. We have to seek the truth and hold on to it.”
