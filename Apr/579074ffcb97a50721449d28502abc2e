A co-covener of' the #BringBackOurGirls, Aisha Yesufu says one benefit of the incompetent administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is the call for a national dialogue. Yesufu said the country needs to have a conversation that would either bind the peoples as one or make them go as sovereign nations. Aisha Yesufu The human rights activist joined a league of Nigerians lending their voices to the possibility of disintegration of the country as a solution to its current predicament. The leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, a Yoruba freedom fighter, Sunday Igboho and some have also continued to agitate for sovereign nations of their respective tribes. Yesufu on her Twitter said, “The nuisance value that might come from this Buhari Presidency might well be the separation of Nigeria. It is glaring that Nigeria needs to have a conversation on whether to remain as one or go its separate ways. I am okay with seeking for visa to Kano, Lagos and Enugu.” Furthermore, she reacted to the pro-Buhari rally in London whereby Nigerians are praying for President Muhammadu Buhari, saying that creativity and empathy needed to run a country and not prayers. “Buhari did not go to the UK for prayers. He went for medical treatment and he is getting it from the healthcare system built by people like him in their country. The healthcare system wasn't built by prayers but by using the greatest miracle God gave humans: brains plus dose of empathy,” Yesufu tweeted. A former Presidential aide, Reno Omokri has mobilised a rally #HarassBuhariOutofLondon to kick against the medical trip of the nation’s President in London, while leaving the country in shambles, the healthcare system inclusive as resident doctors have embarked on a nationwide strike due to non-payment of their salaries by the Nigerian government.
