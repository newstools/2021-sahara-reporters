The former Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi has replied his former boss, Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, that only two official cars and not four are in his possession.  Ajayi, who spoke through his media aide, Allen Sowore, said he returned all vehicles in his control on 23rd February, 2021, the day he completed his tenure excluding the two vehicles, a Land Cruiser and a Hilux Jeep.  He, then, said is entitled to those two vehicles just like other former deputy governors in the state.  According to him, one of the vehicles being demanded was at a mechanic workshop in Okitipupa while the other was still with the dealer because full payment has not been made.  The former Deputy Governor said Governor Akeredolu should be, “prepared not to take any government vehicle at the end of his tenure if he (Agboola) is made to return the two vehicles.  “The former Deputy Governor has joined senior citizens in this state. He should be accorded such respect. On February 23rd when his tenure ended, civil servants came and collected all government vehicles except a Land Cruiser and Hilux jeep which are part of his statutory benefit.  “He is to go home with those two vehicles. He is not holding onto any government vehicles. All other former Deputy Governors in this state are using government vehicles. Nobody should because of politics use indecent language on the former Deputy Governor.  “Let the police invite him. He will explain himself. He is not afraid. One of the other two vehicles had an accident. It is at Okitipupa while the dealer is yet to deliver the second one.”
