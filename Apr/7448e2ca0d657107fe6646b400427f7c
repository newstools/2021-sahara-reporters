1 Day Ago SaharaReporters on Friday reported that suspected gunmen attacked the pastor inside his church in the Jikwoyi area along the Nyanya Road. Pastor Unaegbu of the Goodnews City Church died on Wednesday morning after having a lone vigil in his church. Police sources had told SaharaReporters that the cleric might have been killed by attackers who had attempted to abduct him from the church. According to witnesses, the pastor’s death was discovered in the morning in the church premises when his body was found. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was confirmed dead. “He was barely breathing by the time neighbours and some members discovered him lying in the building. He passed on while being rushed to the hospital,” a source added. The incident has reportedly thrown the Nyanya-Jikwoyi area into mourning as Pastor Unaegbu was a popular cleric in the area.
