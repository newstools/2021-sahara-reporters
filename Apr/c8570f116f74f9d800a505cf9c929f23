Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has alleged a plan by men of the Nigerian Army to carry out attackson certain areas in Imo State.  In a tweet on Wednesday, Kanu urged residents of Mbaise Mbano and Obowo axes of the state to be at alert as there were reports that drones by the Nigerian Army had been deployed to the areas. Nnamdi Kanu He also alleged that the soldiers were advancing with many Hilux vans to the aforementioned areas.  The separatist called on members of the Eastern Security Network to defend their lands from those he called "terrorists in uniform".  His tweet read, “Danger! There is a confirmed report of sightings of @HQNigerianArmy drone over Mbaise, Mbano & Obowo with many Hilux Vans moving into these areas right now. Men MUST be at alert to repel these terrorists in uniform. Imo State is the battleground. We must defend our land!"  DANGER â ï¸!!! There is confirmed report of sightings of @HQNigerianArmy drone over Mbaise, Mbano & Obowo with many Hilux Vans moving into these areas right now. Men MUST be at alert to repel these terrorists in uniform. IMO State is the battle ground. We must defend our land!  SaharaReporters recalls that in February 2021, military fighter jets were deployed by the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Air Force to Orlu communities in Imo State.  The fighter jets reportedly conducted aerial strikes and were believed to be connected with the military’s resolve to dislodge the Eastern Security Network operatives said to have strongholds in the forests.  “Nigerian soldiers are currently conducting aerial strikes in our areas. Many innocent lives may be lost. They are probably looking for ESN operatives who are checking the activities of killer Fulani herdsmen,” a community head told SaharaReporters.  SaharaReporters last December reported that the Nigerian Army deployed combat helicopters, gun trucks, and soldiers to search some suspected forests in the South-East states where the ESN, launched by Nnamdi Kanu, was said to be camping.  A video, from the drones and hidden cameras believed to be installed by the ESN, had captured the Nigerian Army helicopters and their vehicles and soldiers searching for the camp of the ESN for possible arrests.
