The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and other agencies have foiled an attempted jailbreak by inmates in Edo State. The inmates tried to escape from the Nigerian Correctional Service at Ubiaja area in the Esan-South East Local Government Area of the state. File Photo Richard Ogbebor, the Public Relations Officer in a statement said the incident occurred from 2pm to 5pm on Wednesday. The corps deployed a team led by Samuel Ogbeide, an Assistant Superintendent of Corps 1, to the facility. By then, the inmates had broken out from their cells and were engaging correctional officers in a fight. Some sustained injuries. Ogbefor said troops from the Nigerian Army 4th Brigade and police officers assisted in overpowering the prisoners. The NSCDC spokesman added that security has been beefed up at the centre. In a similar incident that happened in Owerri, Imo State, more than 1800 inmates had fled he correctional facility although 107 returned as of Tuesday. The NCS National Public Relations Officer, Francis Enobore, had confirmed this to SaharaReporters, noting that the service believed that with the release of the fleeing inmatesâ€™ photographs and bio-data, there would be more returning. Last week, about 1,884 inmates were freed when gunmen struck the Correctional Centre and the Imo State Police Command headquarters in Owerri. The attackers who razed no fewer than 50 vehicles had also attacked a military base at Ukwuorji on the Owerri-Onitsha Expressway and burnt a soldier in a car before they fled. During the attack, one person suspected to be a fleeing inmate was hit by a bullet while carrying his travel bag. His lifeless body was seen on the ground in front of the correctional centre located near the Government House, along Okigwe Road.
