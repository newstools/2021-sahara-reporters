The Ogun State Police Command has arrested a 50-year-old man, Azeez Agboola, for allegedly parading himself as a lawyer before a Chief Magistrate Court in the Agbara area of the state. SaharaReporters learnt that Agboola was arrested on Wednesday while appearing as a counsel before Chief Magistrate B. I. Ilo at the court.  However, his presentation aroused the suspicion of the Chief Magistrate who invited the police to arrest him for proper interrogation. According to the police on Thursday, it was during the cross-examination that it was revealed that he indeed studied law but was never called to the bar as he did not pass the required exams. The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed Agboola’s arrest in a statement, adding that he would be charged to court. The police spokesman said, “Agboola, a resident of Oko Afor area of Badagry, Lagos State, was arrested while appearing as a counsel before Chief Magistrate B. I. Ilo, at the Chief Magistrate Court, Agbara. “His presentation in court aroused the suspicion of the chief magistrate, who invited the police to arrest him for proper interrogation, in order to authenticate his claim of being a lawyer. “Upon his arrest, the suspect was personally interrogated by the Divisional Police Officer of the Agbara division where he confessed that though he read law in the university, he has not been called to the bar since he has not passed the law school examination. “Meanwhile, the commissioner of police, CP Edward Awolowo Ajogun has ordered that the suspect be charged to court as soon as possible.”
