Libere village is located around a thick forest across River Kaduna from Kasuwan Magani Kalla village which makes it hard for security operatives to respond quickly to any attack in the area. The incident is coming on the heels of bandits’ attack on Greenfield University along the Kaduna – Abuja highway in Chikun Local Government Area of the state, killing a staff member of the institution while several students were abducted. Three of the abducted students were found dead on Friday.
