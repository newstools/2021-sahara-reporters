However, three of the students have escaped, while one is still in captivity. SaharaReporters Media The school is an arm of Calvary ministries andÂ is about 60 kilometres from Jos, the state capital.  A global mission leader and President Para-Mallam Peace Foundation, Reverend Gideon Para-Mallam confirmed to Channels TV that the attackers broke the rear fence of the school where a hole was drilled to gain access into the school compound and abducted the students.
