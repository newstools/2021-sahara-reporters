The Kaduna State House of Assembly has declared the seat of its former Speaker, Aminu Abdullahi Shagali vacant. Shagali, who represents Sabon Gari constituency, had his seat declared vacant on Tuesday.  It was learnt that the lawmaker’s seat was declared vacant for allegedly absconding from all activities at the Assembly for more than a year without giving any reason. The Assembly, during the plenary presided by Deputy Speaker Isaac Auta Zankai, directed its Clerk to inform the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of the decision of the House and announce a date for the re-run election for the seat. The lawmakers also extended the suspension of four other members: Yusuf Liman (Makera); Isah Hazo (Basawa); Nuhu Goro Shadalafiya (Kagarko) and Hon Salisu Isa (Magajin Gari) for another 12 months. Shagali had resigned as Speaker of the Assembly in February after submitting his resignation letter to the Clerk of the House. It was gathered that he had quickly taken the decision as there was a plan by his colleagues to impeach and signatures were already being gathered to do so.
