A group identified as All Progressives Congress Youth of Nigeria has given the Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle two weeks to end insurgency, killings and other terrorist activities in the state. The group also asked the governor to explain the rationale behind his administration's insistence on negotiating with bandits. Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara-state The national coordinator of the group, Suleiman Shuaibu Shinkafi, who briefed journalists on Tuesday, warned that the governor would be dragged to the ECOWAS court after two weeks if he fails to comply with the directive. Shinkafi said, “The reason for this ultimatum for the governor is because the issue of insecurity is too much in Zamfara state. The killings and kidnappings are still so much in the state. Our people are suffering. We don't know why the governor insisted on negotiating with bandits in Zamfara state even when the approach is not working. “Even America, the super power doesn't negotiate with terrorists, so why will the governor continue to negotiate with bandits? "These are some of the issues we discussed and that of his defection, thus, a resolution was reached. The state has only 14 local government areas and therefore we see no reason why he is insisting on negotiation. Even while they are in the process of negotiating, people are being killed on a daily basis without any pause. "Therefore if Matawalle does not come out to tell us his reasons for continuing with the negotiation in two weeks, we will drag him to ECOWAS court to seek redress.”
