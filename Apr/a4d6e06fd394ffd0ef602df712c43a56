A 20-year-old suspect, Ahmad Muhammad has told Osun State Police Command that he set up camps near expressways to kidnap travellers with ease. Muhammad, who is from Tambuwal community in Sokoto State, was arrested at Wasinmi, a village along Ife/Ibadan Expressway. 





While being paraded at the police headquarters in Osogbo, the state capital, he said he was one of the seven gang members who abducted passengers on the expressway, adding that he was arrested during a shoot-out with police. “We kidnapped two people along Ibadan/Gbongan Expressway after we made a roadblock. The police were alerted and they faced my gang in a gun battle during which my other gang members ran away with the kidnapped victims. It is painful that my other gang members left me alone in that bush and ran away,” he said. “It was easy for the police to arrest me because I don’t know the routes in that bush and I could not trace my steps to the place where my other gang members escaped to.” He identified his gang members as Alhaji, Buba, Siraju, Sadiq, Saidu. “My gang members are all Fulani and they are not new in the business, it is a means of survival. I don’t have a shelter, I live along the expressway. I live on the road to make operation ease,” Muhammad disclosed.
