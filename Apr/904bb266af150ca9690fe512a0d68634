Edo state governor, Godwin Obaseki says he won’t take issues with the Nigerian government over his claim that N60 billion was printed in March to support allocation to states. At the Edo transition committee stakeholders engagement on Saturday, Obaseki had said the money was shared at the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting.  “When we got FAAC for March, the federal government printed additional N50-N60 billion to top up for us to share. This April, we will go to Abuja and share. By the end of this year, our total borrowings are going to be within N15-N16 trillion,” he had said. But the Nigerian government on Wednesday faulted his claim, describing it as untrue. Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said Obaseki’s claim was very sad because it was “untrue”. She also defended the government’s borrowings despite the concern expressed by the governor on the rising debt profile which he said Nigeria is in ‘huge financial trouble’. Reacting on Thursday in a statement personally signed by him, Obaseki asked the Nigerian government to brace itself for the economic challenges, instead of playing the Ostrich over the parlous state of the economy. He said, “While we do not want to take issues with the Federal Ministry of Finance, we believe it is our duty to offer useful advice for the benefit of our country. “The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed should rally Nigerians to stem the obvious fiscal slide facing our country. “Rather than play the Ostrich, we urge the government to take urgent steps to end the current monetary rascality, so as to prevent the prevailing economic challenge from degenerating further. “We believe it is imperative to approach the Nigerian project with all sense of responsibility and commitment and not play to the gallery because ultimately, time shall be the judge of us all.”
