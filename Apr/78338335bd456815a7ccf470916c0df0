The minority leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu has joined calls for the sacking or resignation of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami. Many Nigerians have called for the sacking or resignation of Pantami after some comments he made some years ago suggesting religious extremism came into light. Ndudi Elumelu "We are all happy whenever unbelievers are killed,” Pantami once said as an Islamic scholar and cleric. He also hailed Osama Bin Laden, who orchestrated the terrorist attacks on United States soil on September 11, 2001, saying the terrorist "is a better Muslim than myself." See Also
