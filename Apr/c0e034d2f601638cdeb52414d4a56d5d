4 Days Ago There were speculations that the initiative was funded by the former Governor of Lagos State or people loyal to him. In several photos and videos making the rounds, residents were seen with bags of rice with the inscription ‘JAGABA - Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’. An Instagram username @mansurah_isah of Today’s Life Foundation uploaded pictures of the event with a caption appreciating Tinubu’s foundation for the food items. However, Tinubu said he was not responsible for the initiative. “We have seen the images being circulated of bags of rice depicting Asiwaju’s face being distributed across parts of the North,” Tinubu said. He, however, commended the efforts of the various groups for their benevolence. “I am not responsible for this initiative but l commend the efforts of the various volunteer groups responsible for this benign act of charity and love for one another, particularly in this Holy month of Ramadan”. The development comes amid claims that Tinubu is nursing presidential ambition ahead of 2023 although he has not publicly confirmed it. See Also
