Ahmed Musa’s sensational transfer to Kano Pillars has been applauded by Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr, who said he believes his captain can gain match fitness at the NPFL club. Ahmed Musa became a free agent in October when he parted ways with Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr and he will now be at Pillars till he agrees on terms with a foreign club.  “I am delighted for Ahmed Musa to be able to play again with his old club of Kano Pillars,” Rohr said. “This will allow him to keep in shape while waiting to find a club elsewhere in the world.” “Kano Pillars are a good club and I wish him all the best at the club,” he added.
