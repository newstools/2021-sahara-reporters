Judiciary workers under the aegis of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) have begun a nationwide protest on Monday while on indefinite strike to demand financial autonomy for the Judiciary. The protest is led in Abuja by the National Treasurer of the union, Comrade Jimoh Alonge who declared they will not bend their rules on the strike and protest until their demands are addressed.  JUSUN had on April 6 shut down all courts in the country, including the Supreme Court, to protest against the rejection by governors to conform to the constitutional provisions for financial autonomy of the judiciary.

1 Week Ago However, after talks with the governors, JUSUN threatened to also embark on mass protest along with the strike. Alonge, while speaking with journalists at the Court of Appeal headquarters, where the protest to the National Assembly kicked off, said that the judiciary was confronted with myriads of problems, but noted that once the issue of financial autonomy was addressed, others would be taken care of. He accused the governors of Ebonyi and Kaduna states, Dave Umahi and Nasir El-Rufai respectively of undermining the judiciary in their states, warning that the judiciary would no longer tolerate such from anyone.
