The Ogun State Police Command has dismissed three policemen, who were involved in the forceful extortion of N153,000 from one Sheriff Adedigba, a student of the Lagos State University. The command stated on Tuesday that the three policemen namely Inspector Sunday John, Sergeant Jimoh Asimiya and Sergeant Solomon Adedapo were found guilty after an orderly room trial and dismissed.  They were alleged to have extorted the said amount from the victim while he was travelling from Abeokuta to Lagos. Having heard about the incident on social media, the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, ordered the immediate arrest and detention of the officers involved in the extortion. The three policemen were quickly identified and apprehended. According to a statement by police spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, the money was recovered from them and returned to the victim. He said, "They were subsequently arraigned for departmental orderly room trial on three counts of corrupt practices, discreditable conduct and disobedience to lawful order. "They were found guilty of all the charges, and subsequently dismissed from the force to serve as a deterrent to others in their shoes. "The victim, who was also present to give evidence was full of praise for the CP and the management team, for their prompt response to the incident, which he said rekindled his hope in the Nigeria police force. "Meanwhile, the CP has appealed to members of the public to always endeavour to report any act of misconduct from any officer of the command to him personally, or through any of the principal officers of the command, as such will be treated with utmost urgency. "He also warned officers of the command to desist from any act capable of tarnishing the image of the command as such will not be condoned."
