A 54-year old man, Segun Olowokere, arrested for allegedly defiling a 10-year old girl with Down's syndrome, has denied that he had carnal knowledge of the girl, claiming he only inserted his finger into her private parts. Olowokere, a porter at Logo Ademola Female Hostel, University of Lagos, had perpetrated the act at Kusa Street, Pedro area of Bariga, Lagos where both the victim and culprit reside. Illustration He was arrested by the Police operatives from Gender Unit, Shomolu Division, Lagos, where he is undergoing interrogation over the dastardly act. This follows a report at the police station by a mandated reporter who got hint of the abuse. The suspect, upon interrogation, told the DPO that the young girl had informed him that she was wearing red pants and he requested to see her underwear. And from there, he inserted his finger into her private parts before he was caught by their neighbours. The victim was said to have cried and pointed at her private parts, stating that Olowokere touched her bum. According to a police source, the insertion of finger into the private parts is penetration, as such Olowokere may likely be charged before the court for defilement, which attracts several years of imprisonment if he is found guilty.
