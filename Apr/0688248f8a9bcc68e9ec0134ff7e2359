Suspected Fulani kidnappers have kidnapped their tribesmen in Ayete and Iganna in the Oke Ogun area of Oyo State. They have demanded N10 million in ransom from the Ayete victim and N3 million from his Iganna counterpart.  According to Tribune Online, one of the victims, Amadu Shehu Imoru, aged 40, was abducted around 7 pm on Friday at Oba Ayete settlement when armed men invaded the village, shooting indiscriminately. The victim’s father, Imoru Gafar, told the police the abductors called the line of another of his sons on Saturday, demanding N10 million as ransom. Gafar further told the police that the caller’s voice was that of Bororo Fulani. Two days before the incident, on Wednesday, it was gathered that one Alhaji Kusore Shadani was on a footpath along Ilaji Ile Farm Settlement en route to Ibudo Musa with one Shaibu Bello to sell four cows, when he was waylaid by four masked men, who kidnapped and took him to an unknown destination. On Thursday, the kidnappers were said to have called a brother of Alhaji Kusore, demanding N3 million as ransom. When contacted, the Oyo State Police Public Relations Officer, Adewale Osifeso confirmed the incidents, saying the police were trailing the abductors, to arrest them and rescue the victims.
