The tow truck driver killed on the job in Sacramento, California last weekend was a father of three, and his widow says he was a man of many dreams. Ogechi Ugorji, a Nigerian, is in mourning and shaken by the sudden loss of her husband Obinna Ugorji â€“ the loving father of their three young children ages 4, 2 and 10 months.  "His kids miss him so much," Ogechi said in a report by CBS Sacramento. The Nigerian-American family had moved to the Sacramento area to live out big dreams. Obinna was the owner of a company that included a towing operation. He was planning to expand. "He's a man of dreams, of many dreams. The tow truck company is just a part of it," his wife said. Ugorji was on what would have been one of his last calls of the night Saturday when he helped a stranded driver and was hit and killed outside his tow truck on Interstate 5 near Seamus Avenue. "We are heartbroken as a family," Obinna's brother said. The California Highway Patrol arrested the driver who hit Obinna. Larry Godbold is facing DUI and gross vehicular manslaughter charges. "Driving under the influence needs to stop. A lot of lives, too many lives, have been lost," Obinna's brother said. The family is struggling with the sudden loss. Obinna's wife is now facing a future of raising three children alone after he was killed in such a senseless act. Ogechi says she is concerned about their financial situation as Ugorji was the sole income provider in her family.
