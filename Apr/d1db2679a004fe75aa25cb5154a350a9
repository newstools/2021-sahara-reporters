Nigeria’s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami and some Northern Muslim leaders in 2010 plotted to kill former governor of Kaduna state, Patrick Yakowa, a communique adopted at the meeting of Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI) at Bauchi Central Mosque has showed. The meeting chaired by Pantami claimed that having Yakowa, a Christian as governor of the state was uncalled for and a insult to Islam in the country.  “The present development given Patrick Yakowa to rule Kaduna State is totally uncalled for and it’s a slap to Islam in Nigeria. It’s considered as equal to a Christian ruling in Mecca. “The most worrisome situation is where Governor Yakowa is making move to contest for the seat of governor in 2011 and hoping to use government machines at his disposal.
