This comes exactly a month after two farmers were killed in Isaba Ekiti, in Ikole Local Government Area of the state by suspected herders. Prior to the attack last month, two herdsmen were sent to prison in Ondo State for killing a farmer. The Ekiti victims were killed by armed men following a disagreement which ensued with herders on the farm on March 6. It was gathered that one of the victims was a man popularly called Jisoro in the town, while the other one served as a security guard at a construction company. The suspects were said to have fled the scene of the incident after killing the victims.
