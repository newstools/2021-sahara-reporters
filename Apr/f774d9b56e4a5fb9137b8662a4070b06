The identities of some Bureau De Change operators arrested for facilitating the transfer of money to Boko Haram terrorists have been revealed. In a report by Daily Trust, some of the operators were arrested in connection with the incident.  Some of them were traders at the foreign exchange open market in Wapa, Fagge Local Government of Kano state. Prominent among the BDC operators arrested in the state are: Baba Usaini, Abubakar Yellow (Amfani), Yusuf Ali Yusuf (Babangida), Ibrahim Shani, Auwal Fagge and Muhammad Lawan Sani (a gold dealer). In March, Senior Special Assistant to The President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said the Nigerian Government had arrested some Bureau De Change operators who were facilitating the transfer of money to Boko Haram terrorists. He had said some Nigerians transferring money to the sect from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were working with the BDC operators. “Bureaus de change are facilitating money to terrorists. We have already worked with the UAE. Convictions have been achieved of Nigerians who are transferring money to Boko Haram terrorists and this also happens domestically. And I tell you that by the time we finish this investigation, the shocking details will surprise many Nigerians,” Shehu had said. Dozens of persons have been arrested by security agents in an ongoing nationwide crackdown on suspected financiers and collaborators of Boko Haram. Those arrested are being kept in military and DSS facilities in Abuja and other places. Multiple sources informed Daily Trust that the closely guarded operation is being coordinated by Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), in collaboration with the Department of State Services (DSS), the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
