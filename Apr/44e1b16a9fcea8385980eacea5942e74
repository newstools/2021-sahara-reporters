19 Hours Ago SaharaReporters had reported that Odumakin died on Saturday at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital Covid Isolation Centre, according to his wife, Mrs Joe Okei-Odumakin. Adebanjo had in a tweet described the death of the Afenifere spokesman as “too heavy to bear”. Odumakin spoke tenaciously for the rights of the Yoruba and the people of the South-West geopolitical zone. He was also a staunch critic of the policies and programmes of  President Muhammadu Buhari. The late Afenifere spokesman, amongst other things, canvassed restructuring, fiscal federalism, and decentralised policing as solutions to the country’s socio-economic challenges. Before his death, he consistently condemned the activities of criminal Fulani herders, who have been accused of farmland destruction, rape, killings and abductions in the South-West.
