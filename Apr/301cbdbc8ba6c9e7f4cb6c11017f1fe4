TheSun Yakasai disclosed this during his interview with Nigerian Tribune on Sunday. The former Kano State Commissioner of Information also said that the biggest mistake Nigerians made in recent times was electing Buhari as the president of the country. He, however, said that disintegration of Nigeria is not the solution to its numerous problems, adding that the regions will face a similar fate if they break away. "I have never supported and will never support Buhari. I know Buhari has no competence to rule the country. I have never changed my mind about his lack of competence to lead the country. "I didn't support Buhari because I knew he could not solve our problems as a country. The capacity is not just there. I would join effort to look for somebody who can solve our problems," Yakasai said.
