A presidential aide, Lauretta Onochie has said that President Muhammadu Buhari has the right to visit his personal doctors outside Nigeria regardless of the public criticism surrounding his recent trip abroad. The President left the country for London, UK last Tuesday for a medical check-up. Lauretta Onochie The criticisms have led to a series of protests initiated by an ex-Presidential aide, Reno Omokri, at the Abuja House in London where the President is lodged. A fresh protest organised by #RevolutionNow convener, Omoyele Sowore, has been slated for today in London to force Buhari to go have his medical check-up in Nigeria where doctors are currently on strike. While reacting, Onochie said that no amount of wailing can stop Buhari from embarking on medical trips which he has been doing for years. She tweeted, “Next year, Pres. @MBuhari will go for a routine check-up. “We have been here since 2016. It’s been the same wailing. So, the response will also be the same. “At least, once a year, people across the world see their personal doctors, especially (the) one they have seen for about 40 years. “@MBuhari won’t dump his doctor of about 40 years so that wailers can be happy. That’s blackmail. Thankfully, he doesn’t pay blackmailers. “In 2016, I ran from one media house to the other, educating us on the psychology of the bond between a patient & his/her long-standing doctor. “He went for #CheckUp in 2017, 2018, 2019 & in 2020, just before the pandemic. Same wailing and same explanations. “The fact remains that if @MBuhari chooses, he will go for checkups in 2022 & 2023. He will continue to go. It’s his choice to go or not to. “I don’t know any man who will accept a different barber to cut his hair if the one he is used to, is not available. “Wailing can’t take away his rights to see his personal doctors so wailers must get ready for two more years of wailing and fooling around. God bless Nigeria.”
