A Nigerian soldier, Lance Corporal Agboola Kayode (11NA/66/10381) says he was shot by M. A. Isa, an official of the World Food Programme (WFP) under the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) three months after his wedding ceremony. SaharaReporters had earlier reported how Isa, a retired Major negligently fired and shot Kayode in his left limb during a training organised by WFP in Maiduguri on March 28, 2018.  The Ondo-born soldier, who is currently physically challenged, was however abandoned by the UN and Isa. See Also

3 Weeks Ago Speaking to SaharaReporters on Monday, Kayode claimed he could no longer perform his duty as a man since the incident happened three years ago. He added he has been in and out of different hospitals for treatment, yet no solution. “The incident happened just three months after my marriage, since then, I have not been able to perform my duty as a man. Doctors confirmed that I have sciatic nerve injury. “They also said it’s a lifetime injury, I have burning sensation. A burning pain since the day I was shot, I’m just 31, for how long will I continue like this? “Yet, there has never been a time Isa or WFP under the UNDP showed me concern or compassion. I have been in and out of hospital, battling with the bills of my medical treatment personally. “The incident rendered me physically challenged and affected my productivity in life. The affected leg is already deformed and has caused me pain, physically, emotionally and financially.”
