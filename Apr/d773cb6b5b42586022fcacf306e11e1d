A senator representing Ekiti Central in Ekiti State, Opeyemi Bamidele, has said he is not convinced that President Muhammadu Buhari is aware of the security challenges currently ravaging the country. Bamidele said this on Tuesday on the floor of the Senate while contributing to a motion sponsored by the senator representing Niger East, Mohammed Sani Musa.  Musa had drawn the attention of the Senate to reports that Boko Haram had hoisted its flag in the Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger state. But during his contribution, Bamidele suggested that there should be a meeting of the Senate leadership, PresidentMuhammadu Buhari and relevant stakeholders to find solutions to the country’s security challenges. “I’m not even convinced that Mr President is aware of everything that is happening. And if you (Lawan) are meeting with the commander-in-chief, all the service chiefs and all the relevant people will be there,” he said. Former Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, who represents Enugu West senatorial district, said, “Any government that cannot protect its citizens has lost legitimacy. “We should not be ashamed to seek support. The time has come for the Nigerian state to shut down and protect its citizens. It’s time to shut down this Senate and in an executive session find a solution to this problem.”
