The national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, on Thursday erroneously referred to the wife of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as “the wife of the President.” He made the gaffe while speaking at the launch of Aisha Buhari’s biography titled, ‘Aisha Buhari: Being different’.  Tinubu was the chairman of the event, held at the Banquet Hall, presidential villa, Abuja. In a video, while acknowledging dignitaries in the audience, Tinubu said: “Your excellency President Muhammadu Buhari, ably represented by the chief of staff; his excellency the vice president, Yemi Osinbajo; her excellency first lady, Aisha Muhammadu Buhari; your excellency, wife of the president, Dolapo Osinbajo.” After the blunder, Tinubu paused for a couple of seconds before resuming his remarks. This is the second of such slips from the former Lagos governor in the past two weeks. Recall that on March 29, Tinubu said 50 million youths should be drafted into the army to avert a situation where they will be lured by bandits. He made the comment while speaking at the colloquium to mark his 69th birthday in Kano. See Also
