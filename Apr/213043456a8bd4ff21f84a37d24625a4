During the weekend, a member of the House of Representatives from Toro Federal Constituency of Bauchi state, Umar Muda Lawal on his Twitter page shared pictures of deep wells he said he was constructing in some towns and villages in his constituency. “This time we are going outside the box to construct 10 deep wells in 10 rural towns and villages of Toro Local Government Area (LGA), because traditional wells are often more reliable and last longer than any modern small-scale water supply system. Most wells today are centuries old and still working,” Lawal captioned the pictures in a post on Twitter.
