The President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan has sworn in on Tuesday, Frank Ibezim as the All Progressives Congress-elected member to represent the Imo-North Senatorial District. Ibezim replaced the late Benjamin Uwajumogu who died last year.  The Clerk of the Senate, Ibrahim El-Ladan, administered the oath of office and oath of allegiance. Ibezim became an elected senator through a by-election to fill the vacant seat which was held some months ago. The controversy surrounding the emergence of Ibezim has been that the Independent National Electoral Commission declared APC as the winner but did not announce any specific person as the occupant of the seat. Ibezim was declared the winner by the Supreme Court after the issue had persisted between him and Ifeanyi Ararume.
