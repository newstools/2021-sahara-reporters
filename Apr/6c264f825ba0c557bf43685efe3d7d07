By attacking agricultural players across the nation, they seek to ravage the farming community and visit misery on the rest of the country through food scarcity and food costs that poor people can not afford. “In effect, these mean forces seek to impose a food production and distribution crisis on us by disrupting strategically critical agricultural areas and activities. All of these has underscored the importance of the farming sector to our collective condition."
