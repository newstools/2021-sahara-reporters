The convener of Concerned Nigerians, a civil society organisation, Deji Adeyanju, has warned that the death of Chadian President, Idriss Deby and the attendant rising insecurity in Chad will affect events in Nigeria. Deby was announced dead on Tuesday from injuries sustained while fighting with the country’s troops in the frontlines against the rebels who advanced towards the state capital, Ndjamena.  His death came after he was re-elected for the sixth term in office. Adeyanju, a popular Abuja-based activist warned Nigerian leaders to have a deep thought about President Deby’s death. According to him, the insecurity in Chad will end up affecting Nigeria and its sub-region if not tackled. Adeyanju on his Twitter page wrote, “Chad’s President, Idriss Deby has been shot dead in the frontlines in a battle with rebels. He had ruled the country since 1990 and just won a 6th term. May God have mercy on his soul. He was very courageous.
