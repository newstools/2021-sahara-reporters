SaharaReporters Media Governor David Umahi had on Tuesday confirmed the killing of two persons in a renewed boundary dispute between Exilic community and neighboring Iyionu community. Both communities are in Ishielu local government area of the state. It could not be immediately established if the shooting is connected with the dispute. A passenger from Afam Cyprian, who was travelling to Enugu, said travellers had been stranded at Okpoto for about one hour. He said military patrol vans were patrolling the highway but had told them not to advance. “Many people are looking for another route to take. Some have gone back to take Afikpo Road. I am looking for a way to go back to Abakaliki,” he said. Police spokesperson, Loveth Odah confirmed the shootings. She said the police commissioner, Aliyu Garba has dispatched police patrol teams to restore peace and open up the road for users. She however said the shooting could not have been related to the boundary dispute as the disputed area is not close to the highway.
