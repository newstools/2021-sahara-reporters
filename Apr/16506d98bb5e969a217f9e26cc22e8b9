Reno Omokri, ex-aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, has again slammed President Muhammadu Buhari over his medical trip to the United Kingdom. Omokri and some Nigerians had earlier staged a protest at the Nigeria House in London against the President, who is currently in London for a medical checkup, since last Friday.  He has also in several Twitter posts questioned the decision of the President to have himself treated in London after reportedly failing to build a single hospital in Nigeria. On Tuesday night, Omokri highlighted the hypocrisy of the President questioning why Buhari will ban foreign rice and embark on a foreign medical trip. He wrote, “You ban foreign rice and plan foreign healthcare. Ore wa (Our friend), reason the matter now? Your foreign doctors now know you more intimately than @AishaMBuhari. Any foreign agent can use them to compromise you. We’re not your enemies. We just want you to have sense #HarassBuhariOutofLondon.” You ban foreign rice and plan foreign healthcare. Ore wa, reason the matter now? Your foreign doctors now know you more intimately than @AishaMBuhari. Any foreign agent can use them to compromise you. Weâre not your enemies. We just want you to have sense #HarassBuhariOutofLondon  Buhari had in October 2019 ordered the closure of the land borders to all movement of goods. The comptroller-general of the Nigerian Customs Service, Hameed Ali, had said this was part of an effort to curb smuggling. He had said, "All goods, for now, are banned from being exported or imported through our land borders and that is to ensure we have total control over what comes in. "We are strategising on how best the goods can be handled when we eventually get to the point where this operation will relax for the influx of goods.
