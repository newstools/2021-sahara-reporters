The academic calendar has been distorted. It will, therefore, not be possible to have the examination in May/June this year. A convenient International timetable for the conduct of the examination will soon be released.” The spokesperson said the arrangement was in line with the current academic calendar and was done in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Education. Areghan had earlier revealed that registration for the May/June 2021 WASSCE was ongoing and said about 1.8 million candidates had registered for the school examination.
