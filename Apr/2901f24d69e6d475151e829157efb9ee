Few days after men of the Nigerian Army opened fire on peaceful #EndSARS protesters at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of the state confirmed the deaths of two persons. Sanwo-Olu disclosed this in an interview with CNN’s Becky Anderson on October 26, 2020.  The governor said two deaths were confirmed from the Lekki shooting. “Two dead bodies, that is what we have seen from all the morgues, that’s what we have seen going to hospitals, that’s what we have seen as a record. “What has happened is that there have been so many footages that were seen, that people have shown, but we have not seen bodies, we have not seen relatives, we have not seen anybody truly coming out to say I am a father or a mother to someone and I cannot find that person. Nobody has turned up. I have been to the ground; there is no scratch of blood anywhere there. “From the footage that we could see, because there were cameras at that facility, it seems to me that they would be men in military uniform. That’s what the footage shows,” Sanwo-Olu had said. Hours before a curfew was scheduled to begin on October 20, 2020, soldiers had stormed the Lekki Toll Gate where protesters had gathered and started shooting. Though, the Nigerian Army initially denied soldiers were at the scene. It later admitted soldiers were there on the invitation of the state government, but insisted they shot no one, despite video evidence showing otherwise.
