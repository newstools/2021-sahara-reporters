President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the United States to consider moving the headquarters of the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) from Germany to Africa. The President made the request on Tuesday during a virtual meeting with Anthony Blinken, US Secretary of State.  The request was based on the growing security challenges in the continent. AFRICOM, headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany, focuses on addressing security challenges affecting African countries. “During a virtual meeting with the US Secretary of State, @SecBlinken, President @MBuhari asked the United States to consider relocating the headquarters of the US Africa Command (@USAfricaCommand) from Germany,” the Personal Assistant on New Media to President Buhari, Bashir Ahmad tweeted this on Tuesday. Also, a statement by Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, quoted the President as saying, “The security challenges in Nigeria remain of great concern to us and impacted more negatively, by existing complex negative pressures in the Sahel, Central and West Africa, as well as the Lake Chad Region. “Compounded as the situation remains, Nigeria and her security forces remain resolutely committed to containing them and addressing their root causes. The support of important and strategic partners like the United States cannot be overstated as the consequences of insecurity will affect all nations hence the imperative for concerted cooperation and collaboration of all nations to overcome these challenges. “In this connection, and considering the growing security challenges in West and Central Africa, Gulf of Guinea, Lake Chad region and the Sahel, weighing heavily on Africa, it underscores the need for the United States to consider re-locating AFRICOM Headquarters from Stuttgart, Germany to Africa and near the Theatre of Operation.”
