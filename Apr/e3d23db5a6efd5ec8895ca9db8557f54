President Muhammadu Buhari says he is in London, the United Kingdom to have a short rest. Buhari disclosed this in his letter on Thursday to King Abdullah ll Bin Al-Hussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, following the resolution of a recent dispute in the royal family, Daily Post reported.  Buhari said he felt much worried when he heard reports of the rift but was reassured when he learnt that everything had been resolved amicably. “While here in London taking a short rest, I was profoundly disturbed to read from international news agencies of attempts to destabilise the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,” his letter had stated. Buhari stated that the King’s exemplary leadership since ascending the throne has attracted global admiration. The President observed relations between Nigeria and Jordan have been excellent as he said, ”I thank you for the part you have played in this relationship. “Your Majesty, I am much heartened that matters have now been resolved and I pray that the Hashemite Kingdom continues to not only remain peaceful, but also a major beacon of hope for the region under Your Majesty’s wise guidance." President Buhari is in London for a medical check-up, but his trip has attracted controversies and protests by people who blame him for always being quick to flee to the UK which has good healthcare, which he has failed to provide in his own country.
