The family of a 24-year-old Kabiru Arekemase, who was allegedly murdered by operatives of the now disbanded Special Anti Robbery Squad in Ibadan, Oyo State, has demanded N250 million compensation from the Nigeria Police Force. The mother of the deceased in a petition Suit No: OYJPPB/083 instituted on behalf of the family against the Nigeria Police sought compensation for malicious arrest and prosecution of their son which led to his extrajudicial killing by SARS operatives as a result of a false allegation of armed robbery levelled against him. File Photo The petition was presented before the panel set up by the state government to look into police brutality and extrajudicial killings. Arekemase's mother also narrated how she became blind after her son, who was the breadwinner of the family was gruesomely killed by SARS. She said her late son was a multilingual person who spoke and understood many languages, standing as a bridge between customers and foreign organisations which made him rich and the breadwinner of the family.According to her, prior to her son’s death, SARS operatives at Dugbe allegedly usually came to their residence at Idi Aro, Ibadan to demand money from her son which her son used to decline, telling them that he was not into any illegal business, so there was no need for any 'settlement'. She said, “My son was arrested by SARS and detained for four months over false allegations of armed robbery even though there was no victim of the offence before he was later charged and arraigned at the chief magistrate court, Iyaganku on 8th of August, 2006 and was later acquitted. “My son was re-arrested by SARS and taken into custody for four months after he was acquitted by court for his failure to meet the SARS monetary demands, while in custody. I used to visit him and take food to him, but one of the SARS officials told me one day that my son had been wasted (killed) by SARS.”
