The All Progressives Congress, APC, has denied endorsing any zonal arrangement ahead of the 2023 presidential election. The APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee made its position known while disowning a zoning list of national officers and political positions for the 2023 presidential election. File Photo The National Secretary Caretaker Committee of APC, John Akpanudoedehe, made the denial in a statement he issued yesterday. A list had gone viral on social media with the title “APC announces zoning arrangement ahead of 2023 election year". In the list, the party was said to have zoned the nation’s presidency and Senate presidency to the South, while its National Chairmanship was zoned to the North. However, Akpanudoedehe, while dismissing the list, said, “People who are interested in running for one office or the other can speculate. As far as I am concerned, at the last Caretaker Committee meeting we had, we did not discuss that. “That is not what we are concerned with now. What we are concerned with is data collection. We are not going to be pressurised by sentiments and then we do the wrong thing. Let me say that zoning is not for the Caretaker Committee alone. It has to do with the President, it has to do with other major stakeholders. It has to do with a lot of people. “I want to mute the speculation. The list is not from us (Caretaker Committee). There is no way such a decision will be taken without consulting with the President, consulting with the governors and other major stakeholders. “People should disregard the list. We are focused on delivering our mandate and we are to do it rightly.”
