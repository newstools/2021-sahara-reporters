The incident is the latest in what appears to be a growing trend of attacks against security personnel in the South-East region of the country.  Last Monday, gunmen attacked the police headquarters and the correctional centre in Owerri, setting 38 vehicles ablaze and freeing 1,844 inmates.  Police stations have also come under attack in the region, with many officers killed.
