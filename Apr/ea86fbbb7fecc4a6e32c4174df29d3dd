Fifteen beheaded bodies were on Tuesday morning found dumped at Five Miles area on the outskirt of Calabar, capital of Cross Rivers state.  The dead bodies comprising both males and females were dumped in a steep valley along the double carriageway under construction, Vanguard reports.  The identities of the bodies have not yet be determined or those who might have dumped them there.  The gory spectacle was discovered by farmers early Tuesday morning.  A crowd gathered around 11.00 am to observe the gory sight while a horde of flies fluttered around the decapitated bodies.  “Some persons may have brought these corpses and dumped here in a vehicle last night,” Alex, a commercial driver, said.  He said the deceased persons might have been killed in Calabar and taken to the lonely area.  ”I wonder why the police and security agents who place road blocks along this road could not intercept them because the odour that can emanate from such bodies can be very strong," he added.  Irene Ugbo, the spokesperson for the state police command did not answer calls to his phone.
