The Acting National Leader of Afenifere, Ayo Adebanjo says President Muhammadu Buhari has a hidden agenda for rejecting calls for restructuring. There have been secession agitations, while some persons have called for Nigeria to be restructured to allow for regional governments. Ayo Adebanjo Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, had dismissed the calls for disintegration, adding that Buhari won’t be bullied into “settling” secessionists. Speaking to journalists at the service of songs and tribute ceremony held for the late Yinka Odumakin, the Afenifere leader asked why the presidential spokesperson would say the president is not interested in restructuring when the people have said what they want. He said that there will be more Igbohos and Nnamdi Kanus if restructuring is not carried out immediately. He said, “The people you are leading are saying this is what will bind them together, but you’re not attending to it, and you’re not giving us alternatives. “How can Garba Shehu say the president is not interested in anything when the people have said this what they want? Did the President not claim to be a born-again democrat? “It’s Buhari that encourages secession. Those of us calling for restructuring are the people who want Nigeria to stay. “They are always quick to mention Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu. These people represent the youths because the suffering in the country is too much for them. “If Nigeria is not restructured, honestly we’ll have more Igbohos and Nnamdi Kanus. l don’t support secession and don’t oppose it either. “Don’t buy the campaign of the people telling you that to restructure is to separate Nigeria. “Buhari is not the man to come and tell me about a united Nigeria. I’ve been preaching a united Nigeria since Buhari was in primary school.”
