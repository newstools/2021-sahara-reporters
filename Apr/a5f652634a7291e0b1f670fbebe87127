President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the appointment of Alkali Baba Usman as the acting Inspector-General of Police. The Minister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi disclosed this on Tuesday while briefing State House correspondents at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Alkali Baba Usman President Buhari had on February 4th, 2021 extended the tenure of Mohammed Adamu as the IGP for three months. The President said the decision to extend the IGP’s tenure for another three months was to give time for proper selection of the new helmsman. This, however, was be contrary to the provisions of the Police Act 2020, which in Section 7 (6) fixes a single term of four years without an option of extension of tenure for the holder of the office of the Inspector-General of Police. “A person appointed to the office of the Inspector-General of Police shall hold office for four years,” it read. Section 18 (8) of the Act signed by President Buhari on September 15, 2020 also read, “Every police officer shall, on recruitment or appointment, serve in the police force for 35 years or until he attains the age of 60 years, whichever is earlier.” Adamu had, however, spent two months and three days out of the three-month extension. His appointment is subject to the approval of the Council of State meeting expected to be convened soon.
