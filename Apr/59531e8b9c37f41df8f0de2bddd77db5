The trial of a former Minister of Aviation, Stella Oduah, by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission over a N9.4 billion fraud may gradually be scuttled going by her secret plot with the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami. SaharaReporters learnt that the trial of Oduah which was supposed to proceed on February 22 could not proceed because the co-defendants with the minister failed to appear before Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja.  The judge had given the prosecution additional weeks and slated April 19. It was gathered that Oduah, who is presently the Senator representing Anambra North in the National Assembly, has met with Lawan and Malami to douse her case with the EFCC. “February 22 has passed but she was not arraigned. April 19 has also passed because of the industrial action of judiciary workers. She is working very hard using the Senate President and AGF to either scuttle arraignment or frustrate the trial. Alternatively, they are planning to water down the trial through the prosecution via the EFCC chairman. “February 22 has passed but she was not arraigned. April 19 has also passed.

1 Month Ago One of the counts in the charge reads, “That you, Stella Adaeze Oduah, whilst being the Minister of Aviation, Federal Republic of Nigeria and Gloria Odita whilst being the Company Secretary to Sea Petroleum & Gas Company Ltd (SPGC), and an aide to the former Minister of Aviation on or about the 12th day of February, 2014 at Abuja within the Abuja Judicial Division of this Honourable Court used your positions to transfer the sum of N1, 629,250,000 from 1-Sec Security Nig.

He therefore applied for an additional 14 days to serve them. Justice Ekwo granted his prayer and adjourned till April 19, 2021, for arraignment.

EFCC To Arraign Ex-Aviation Minister, Stella Oduah, Over Alleged N9.4billion Fraud
0 Comments
2 Months Ago SaharaReporters had on February 9 reported that Oduah would be arraigned for alleged financial impropriety totalling more than N9.4 billion fraud. SaharaReporters had in September 2017 uncovered how Oduah bought a $1.2 million home in London, disguising it in the robes of a foreign-registered company in an effort to avoid detection. The transaction, which had been kept secret, was blown open when Mrs. Oduah decided to rent out the house and engage the services of an estate company. SaharaReporters had also reported in February 2018 that the EFCC had commenced investigation of Oduah, over her involvement in the N9.4 billion contract for supply of security equipment to 22 airports across the country.
