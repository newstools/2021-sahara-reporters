Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan says protesters have successfully put President Muhammadu Buhari under house arrest in London. Buhari is currently in London where he would be spending two weeks to enable him to undergo a medical checkup.  To express their displeasure at the medical trip, Omokri and a group of protesters have been protesting at the gate of the Nigeria House, brandishing placards with different inscriptions. The former presidential aide in a series of tweets said the protesters have made General @MBuhari a prisoner in London. He said, “The #HarassBuhariOutofLondon movement has effectively made General @MBuhari a prisoner at Abuja House. He is under house arrest. “He can’t come out. He can’t sneak out to see his beloved doctors. We have shown him who really has the power. Power belongs to the people! Now he knows. The #HarassBuhariOutofLondon movement has effectively made General @MBuhari a prisoner at Abuja House. He is under house arrest. He canât come out. He canât sneak out to see his beloved doctors. We have shown him who really has the power. Power belongs to the people! Now he knows  “I thank Nigerians for coming out for day 2 of the #HarassBuhariOutofLondon. Somebody suspected to be Buhari was peeping through the window. “Their plan to go to the doctor was frustrated. For the second day, General @MBuhari was trapped at Abuja House. What a good day for Nigeria!” Buhari has embarked on several trips to the UK to seek medical care since he assumed office. In 2019, the President had lamented that Nigeria was losing about N400 billion to medical tourism annually.
