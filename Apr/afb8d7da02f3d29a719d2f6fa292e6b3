The parents of the kidnapped students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka in Kaduna State say they have neither met nor been told the identities of the five students who regained their freedom on Monday. The Kaduna State Government on Monday announced that five of the 39 students abducted from the school dormitory on March 11, 2021 had been recovered by the Nigerian Army.  While the statement revealed that they were undergoing medical check-up at a military facility, it failed to offer the details of how the students were recovered. However, Daily Trust reported that the families of the students have stormed the 1 Division of the Nigerian Army in Kaduna with the hope of seeing the released students but were denied access. One of the parents, who is also the secretary of the parents’ group, Friday Sanni, said the parents had visited 1 Division Nigerian Army again on Tuesday morning but were urged to be patient.
