The immediate former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha has finally spoken out about his arrest by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over alleged misappropriation of public funds. Okorocha was arrested by the EFCC on Tuesday at his Unity House office at Garki, Abuja. @REALROCHAS/TWITTER But speaking through his media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, Okorocha said since the anti-graft agency was only doing its job he would cooperate fully with it. “To us, the Commission is doing its job and should be given the needed co-operation. And Okorocha being a law-abiding citizen, would always cooperate with the Commission over the Matters in Courts. “EFCC is not a slaughter House, but a very responsible institution and should be seen as such,” Onwuemeodo said. He told Nation that the Imo West Senator is being investigated because of the new leadership at the commission. He said: “The truth is that, Okorocha left as the governor of Imo State on May 28, 2019. And shortly after his exit as Governor, Imo State Government wrote petitions upon petitions against him.
