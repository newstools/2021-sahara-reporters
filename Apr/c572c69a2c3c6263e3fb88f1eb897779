Apart from huge sums of money paid as ransom to kidnappers by families of people abducted, hoodlums now demand bags of rice and condiments as part of the payment, Daily Trust reports. Rural communities in Kuje, Kwali, Gwagwalada and Abaji area councils have witnessed sustained attacks by armed kidnappers, who have abducted over 30 people in the last three months and collected ransom running into millions of naira.  But recently, during the abduction of some residents of Kiyi and Anguwar Hausawa community in Kuje and Abaji area councils, the kidnappers told families of their hostages to bring along bags of rice, noodles, spaghetti and cartons of seasoning cubes along with the ransom. It was learnt that family members of eight people who were kidnapped alongside a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, in Kiyi had to purchase foodstuffs and condiments for the kidnappers. A relative of a kidnap victim in Kiyi village, simply identified as Joshua, said he was forced to purchase two bags of rice, one carton of seasoning cubes and a carton of noodles which were taken along with N1.5 million to the kidnappers before the victim was released. “Other family members did the same thing before their kidnapped relatives were released,” he said. He added: “If you fail to buy those things and take only the cash to them, they will collect it and still hold the victim until you get the foodstuffs for them.” Mr. Isaac Jonathan, another relative of a kidnapped victim, told our reporter that he was also forced to buy two of bags of rice, seasoning cubes, cartons of spaghetti, roll of cigarettes and some wines for the abductors of his cousin along Shenegu village in Gwagwalada Area Council, before he regained his freedom.
