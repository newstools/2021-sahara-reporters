Bandits suspected to be kidnappers have abducted two nurses working with Idon General Hospital in the Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The hospital is located less than a kilometre from a police checkpoint along the Kaduna-Kachia Road in Idon. File Photo The incident which occurred in the early hours of Thursday comes barely 48 hours after several students were abducted and one person killed during an attack on Greenfield University along the Kaduna-Abuja highway in the Chikun Local Government Area. The Chairman of Kajuru Local Government Area, Cafra Caino, who confirmed the incident to Channels TV said the bandits stormed the general hospital through the fence with deadly weapons and started shooting sporadically within the hospital premises. He explained that two nurses identified as Afiniky Bako and Grace Inkut who were on night duty were taken away by the bandits. The Chairman also said that plans were underway to boost security in the hospital and its environs to prevent such an attack in the future. One staff member of Greenfield University was killed and scores of students kidnapped in a Tuesday night attack on the private University in Kaduna. Only on Saturday, parents of the remaining 29 students abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna State, revealed that bandits were threatening to kill the male students and get married to their female colleagues. About 39 students were abducted from their college dormitories on March 11, 2020, but 10 of the students – seven male and three females – were released last week after suspected payment of ransoms by their parents.
