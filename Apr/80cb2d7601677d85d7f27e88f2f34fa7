Our people are now living in fear. Many have fled the area while many have been killed. Ijokodo-Agbaje area was peaceful before now. But since a few years back, cultists have been operating in this area.  "The situation now is that people sleep in town, if they cannot make it to their homes by 6 pm. They have killed many people in this area. We are hereby calling on the governor to take action now, else he may not be able to handle the situation again."
