A 31-year-old man, Jivini Jonnan, in Taraba state has allegedly committed suicide after discovering that his fiancée had jilted him and returned to her former boyfriend. Jonnan was said to have taken his life by drinking an insecticide in the Wukari Local Government Area of the state.  A family source told Punch that the deceased was heartbroken after he caught his fiancée in a room with her ex-boyfriend and telling him that she was no longer interested in their relationship even after they had completed the traditional marriage rites. The source stated, “They had gone through the traditional marriage rites and she seemed to love him because they had been in the relationship for over three years. “The traditional wedding was held on March 21 this year, where they both consented to marrying each other. “Jonnan was called by his friends, who told him that they saw his fiancée with her ex-lover, only for him to rush there and find her in the ex-boyfriend’s room. “An altercation ensued and since it was obvious that she had taken sides with her ex-lover, Jonnan left heartbroken, only for us to hear that he committed suicide.” It was gathered that Jonnan was rushed to hospital when he was discovered unconscious, but was pronounced dead by the doctor on duty.
