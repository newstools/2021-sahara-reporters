Former Minister of Education, Oby Ezekwesili, has said that Nigeria under the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, has become “a mass of cumulative failure.” In a Twitter thread on Tuesday, Ezekwesili lamented that with the way things are currently going, Nigeria risks losing its status as a country as it steadily hobbles down the slippery slope under President Buhari. Oby Ezekwesili According to her, recent happenings in Nigeria do not present the country as a progressive one but rather as a 'mass of cumulative failure'. She said Nigeria of today can be compared with countries like Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, among others. Ezekwesili called for a sovereign national conversation.

That high score for all indices of a failing State has placed the country as the world’s 14th most fragile state."
