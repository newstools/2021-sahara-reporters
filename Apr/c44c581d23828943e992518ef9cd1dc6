A resident of Gora community in the Southern part of Kaduna State has cried out for help, saying they now live in fear. Josiah Akau, a youth in the community, said people live in extreme fear of being killed and that soldiers find it difficult to even protect the indigenes.  He said, “Life is not fun again on our side, we need your prayers. We do not feel safe again. There was an attack that occurred close to us some weeks ago and we don't know the next target. Please help us. Soldiers are not ready to protect us, all they do is to protect herdsmen. “We are scared of going to the farm, people have not finished harvesting their farm produce. You cannot go to the bush for fear of being attacked. If you go alone, they will seize your bike and sometimes kill the person in the bush.”  Akau narrated how soldiers attached to the area killed two women and brutalised others some months ago for protesting against the indiscriminate arrest of youths in the area.  According to him, the women had taken to the streets over the continued arrest of youths who were the major forces protecting the area against banditry, among others. The resident said it was unfortunate that soldiers would go after the youths even when they had failed in their primary responsibility of protecting the area.  He said the women protested around the military barracks in the area and insisted on seeing the commander.  Akau explained that the soldiers, however, asked the women to go back but they refused to leave the barracks. According to him, the soldiers thereafter opened fire on the women, killing one Naomi John on the spot while two others also shot were rushed to the hospital. He said one of them later died. He said the soldiers also beat the women, including his mother, adding that many of them sustained varying degrees of injury in the process.
