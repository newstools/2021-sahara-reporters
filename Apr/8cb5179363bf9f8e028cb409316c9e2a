Nasarawa State, Governor Abdullahi Sule, has sworn in Justice Aisha Bashir-Aliyu as substantive Chief Judge of the state. She became the first female Chief Judge in Nasarawa State.  Shortly after administering the oath of office on the new CJ, the governor said his administration takes the judiciary as a critical institution providing the needed impetus to strengthen relationships among organs of government. He added that his administration will continue to support the judiciary towards quick dispensation of justice, stressing that the government had approved an increase in subvention of the judiciary to allow implementation of the harmonisation law as well as enhance allowances of magistrates and judges of Area Courts. Sule appealed to members of the judicial staff union on strike to return to work in the interest of the people. The governor called on Justice Bashir-Aliyu, being the first female CJ in the state, to see her appointment as a litmus test, urging her to bring her wealth of experience to bear in the discharge of her onerous task.
