Prominent Nigerians converged on the Presidential Villa in Abuja to launch a book written in honour of First Lady Aisha Buhari on Thursday. The launch of the biography titled, ‘Aisha Buhari: Being different’ was well attended even though some of the key persons invited were conspicuously absent.  The book was written by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Administration and Women Affairs, Dr Hajo Sani. Aliko Dangote, Femi Otedola, Abdulsamad Rabiu, Muhammadu Indimi, and Jim Ovia were among those who sent representatives. But Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and many governors attended the event. Below is a list of those who bought copies of the book and what they donated, according to a DailyTrust report. Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (N20m) Alhaji Aliko Dangote (N30m) Alhaji Abdulsamad Rabiu (N25m) Mrs Folorunso Alakija (N10m) Chief Kessington Adebutu (N10m).
