The Southern Nigeria And Middle Belt Forum has declared the suspension of all public activities by the group for 30 days to mourn the demise of its National Secretary, Yinka Odumakin. In a statement by Edwin Clark, its leader, the group said it will refrain from engaging in public activities including periodic meetings as a means to honour Odumakin.  SaharaReporters had reported how Odumakin, who also doubled as spokesman for Yoruba socio-political, Afenifere, died on Saturday due to COVID-19 complications. The statement read, “Following the news of the very sad and shocking death of our National Secretary, Comrade Yinka Odumakin, who is also National Spokesman for Afenifere, whose sad event occurred in Lagos in the early hours of Saturday 3rd April 2021, the leadership of Southern Nigeria and Middle Belt Forum, hereby suspends all public engagement by the group for 30 days. “During the period, we will refrain from engaging in public activities including our periodic meetings. This we believe is a modest and fitting honour to one of the most outspoken, inspirational and patriotic Nigerian ever. “We, therefore, like to make a public apology to various groups who have invited our participation in meetings, conferences and similar activities. “We will like to once more convey our deepest condolences to his widow, Mrs Joe Odumakin, his aged parents, the rest of the Odumakin family and our compatriots of Afenifere. May Yinka's courageous soul rest in peace.”
