A female police inspector, Bosede Ajayi, has been reportedly stripped naked by four suspected hoodlums in Akure, Ondo state. The incident occurred on Tuesday when a police team from the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department were sent to invite a suspect in respect of a case of malicious damage and threat to life.  Unfortunately, Ajayi and other members of the police team were attacked by the hoodlums. It was gathered that the policewoman was badly humiliated, manhandled, and stripped naked on the order of one Oladele Samuel, who is the gang leader. Confirming the incident, the state commissioner of Police Bolaji Salami said in a statement: “On April 20, 2021, at about 1000hrs, a team of policemen from State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department was sent to invite a suspect in respect of a case of malicious damage and threat to life. “On getting to the scene, the police team was attacked by some hoodlums, and Inspector Ajayi Bosede was badly humiliated, manhandled, and stripped naked on the order of one Oladele Samuel, the gang leader. “Oladele Samuel practically inflicted injuries on the policewoman and promised to kill anyone who dares him. Inspector Ajayi Bosede, in the process, lost her warrant card, a bunch of keys and a wallet containing eighty thousand naira (₦80,000.00). “Oladele Samuel and his gang were subsequently arrested and they are facing investigation.” The commissioner gave the names of the suspects who attacked and stripped Inspector Ajayi naked as Oladele Samuel, Sunday Babalola, Adesina Isaac, and Olawale Bukola. He added that the four suspects would soon be charged to court after the completion of the investigation. He also stated the Ondo state police command would not tolerate such inhuman treatment of any of its officers. Salami said the command would not treat the matter with levity, adding that the attack on security personnel was unacceptable and condemnable.
