Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN) has suggested that Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State should honour the late spokesperson for Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin, by lifting the ban on students' union activities in the school. Paying tribute to Odumakin in a statement on Monday, Falana noted how the Vice Chancellor of the school, Professor Eyitope Ogunbodede, described the death of Odumakin as not only tragic but also as a monumental loss to the country, the human rights community and OAU. Yinka Odumakin The senior lawyer noted that the university recalled the fact that Odumakin was the "Public Relations Officer of the virile students' union from 1986-1987". Falana said, "However, in his lifetime, Yinka Odumakin always acknowledged that the experience acquired by him as a student leader at the Obafemi Awolowo University contributed to his development and understanding of the society. Consequently, he had cause to express concern over the penchant of the management to proscribe the virile student union of the university. “Therefore, the best tribute that the university can pay to Yinka (Odumakin) is to lift the proscription imposed on the students' union of the Obafemi Awolowo University as soon as possible.” The late Afenifere leader died last Saturday at the intensive care unit of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital where he was being managed for respiratory issues due to complications from COVID-19.
