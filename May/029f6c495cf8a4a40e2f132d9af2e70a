The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has promised to share information that could help the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in its fight against corruption. FRSC Zonal Commander in charge of Kwara, Ekiti and Kogi states (RS8HQ), Clement Oladele, made the promise on Thursday in Ilorin during his visit to the Ilorin zonal office of EFCC, NAN reports.  Oladele called for synergy between the two agencies in information sharing, adding that their mandate is to save lives and enhance the development and growth of the nation. He said the purpose of the visit was to build on the existing relationship between the two agencies. He further pledged the support of the corps to the commission in carrying out the task of restoring integrity to the nation through its fight against corruption. In response, the EFCC Zonal Head in Ilorin, Usman Muktar, thanked the team for the words of encouragement and commendation. Muktar said that EFCC would not relent in its efforts to fight corruption, economic and financial crimes to a standstill. He noted that corruption was largely responsible for high carnage on Nigerian roads. “I commend the FRSC in its effort to restore sanity on the roads and I want to stress the need for timely information about the registration of exotic vehicles, as it will help in tracing stolen funds,” he said.
