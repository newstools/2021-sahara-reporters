A Nigerian man identified as Peter Ofor has died after he was allegedly assaulted by police officers in India. According to the deceased sister, Prudent Obi, her brother was killed by some police officers in Bengaluru in Karnataka on Tuesday. India Police "It shall never be well ooooooooo with anyone that has hand in your death my brother and the Indian Bangalore police too death will start from today visit them all your spirit shall never rest until you finish them all be Indian Bangalore police or any of our Nigerian person that has hand in ur dead visit them with anger,” she said in a Facebook post. Ofor’s death is coming barely two months after a 43-year-old Nigerian, Leohand Lyeanyi, died following an alleged assault by some police officials in West Delhi's Tilak Nagar, India. An eyewitness had claimed Lyeanyi died because of a Lathi injury inflicted on him by police personnel. Commonly used in South Asia, Lathi is a long, heavy iron-bound bamboo stick used as a weapon, especially by the police.
