The Senator representing Lagos Central District at the Nigerian National Assembly, Remi Tinunu, has come under fire after she was seen in a video verbally assaulting a woman by calling her 'a thug'. Remi, who is a member of the ruling party, All Progressives Congress (APC), is had been heavily criticised on social media as hashtags such as 'thug', 'first lady' and 'remi tinubu' sit at the top of the Nigerian trends table on Twitter.  Remi, wife of a former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, is referred to as prospective first lady of Nigeria following the rumours of a presidential ambition Bola Tinubu is nursing. Despite his denial of having plans to run for the 2023 presidential election, his political activities have proven otherwise. However, with Remi's recent condemnable actions as reported by the media, Nigerians have vehemently kicked against endorsing Bola Tinubu for the 2023 presidency. This is however not the first time the ordained pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God would be involved in a controversy since becoming a Senator in 2011. She recently tackled her colleague, Smart Adeyemi, who raised pertinent questions about the growing insecurity in the country. Adeyemi had during a plenary session said that Nigeria was facing the worst instability since the civil war. “This is the worst instability we are facing. In fact, this is worse than the civil war,” he had said. But Tinubu interrupting him, had asked, “Are you in PDP (Peoples Democratic Party)? Are you a wolf in sheep’s clothing?” Below are some of the reactions:  With Patience Jonathan,You have a woman who actually cared.With Aisha Buhari,You have a woman who spoke against her own husbandâs madness.With Remi TinubuYou will have a First Lady who harass and tyrannise anyone who speaks against govt.May this disaster not hit Nigeria.   I wonder when our future First Lady, Remi Tinubu will be in the news for the right reasons.No class whatsoever.   It's high time the RCCG reconsiders the pastoral position of Remi Tinubu in the church because she doesn't act like one.First Lady Laycon Bashir Thug pic.twitter.com/HCxDuRADBm   Above everything that I wish never to happen is Remi Tinubu becoming Nigerian First Lady.I'd better a merely caring Patience JonathanI'd rather an Aisha Buhari who was bold to speak to inside powers.Remi Tinubu is an asteroid that should never hit Nigeria.   Patience Jonathan was compassionate. Even as she was being mocked, she remained A MOTHER. Aisha Buhari is selfish, but she is not a rascal.Remi Tinubu has not only shown her rascality many times, she has shown her bigotry as well. Remi is not fit for the office of a First Lady.   Remi Tinubu is too loud, arrogant and controversial for someone that is likely to be the next first lady.   The first things politicians lose when they join politics is SHAME but itâs unfortunate that Remi Tinubu not just lost shame but also her sense of humanity.May we never experience a First Lady like her because we might end up appreciating Buhari pic.twitter.com/KRQqQuSqTx   @AsiwajuTinubu & @RemiTinubu are the chief thugs in Lagos State. @mcolumo is their head butcher while wasiu ayinde marshall (k1) is the town crier. My Yoruba people, if una like continue to leverage your souls and freedom to thugs and criminals for 5k. #EndSARS #Biafra #Oduduwa   âLast ladyâ Remi Tinubu always making headlines for the wrong reasons. From Igbos canât be trusted to calling Smart Adeyemi a wolf in sheepâs clothing, and now calling a lady a thug for speaking up. She represents everything anti-people.   @RemiTinubu in the news again for public irresponsibility! Who is a bigger thug than Tinubu in Nigeria?! Remi Tinubu feels her family has a higher stake in Nigeria than others,not realising she is the problem weâre gathering to eradicate #TinubuIsAThug #NoToBAT2023 #BuhariMustGo
