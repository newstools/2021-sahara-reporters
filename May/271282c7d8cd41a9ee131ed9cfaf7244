Their mission also involves capturing the gunmen and bringing them to justice. The Public Relations Officer of Adamawa State Police Command, DSP Sulaiman Nguroje Yahaya revealed this to SaharaReporters on Friday. Diska, the News Editor of the Adamawa State Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), located in Mbamba community in Yola, was kidnapped in the early hours of Tuesday. It was learnt that about 15 gunmen invaded her residence and forcefully took her away, leaving behind her six-month-old baby. The kidnappers upon their arrival into the residence broke the sitting room door and gained access into the bedroom, demanding to see the victim’s husband. Findings revealed that the assailants, who seemed to have targeted Amra’s husband, abducted her when they could not find the man. “It appears the gunmen came with the aim of kidnapping the husband of the journalist. But since they didn’t meet him, they decided to kidnap the nursing mother,” a source said. It was confirmed that the journalist was abducted from her husband’s house at Mbamba between 1:00am and 2:00am. Giving update on the incident Friday morning, the Adamawa Police Command spokesman said, "The Command deployed troops for rescue operation. "We are working in synergy with the NUJ Adamawa and other critical stakeholders to rescue her unharmed and possible arrest of the culprits."
