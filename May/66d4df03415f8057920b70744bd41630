Leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu has advised Tiv men in the Nigerian Army and other security agencies to form a security outfit to defend their villages against Fulani terrorists. According to the IPOB leader, territorial landscapes belonging to Tiv are being ravaged by Fulani herders. IPOB Leader, Nnamdi Kanu The leader of the pro-Biafra group lamented that the Tiv men are foolish to be hunting for civilians in the South-East for the Nigerian government while their own house is on fire. Kanu made this disclosure in a statement released by IPOB spokesman, Emma Powerful on Wednesday. Just two weeks ago, the leader of Tiv sociocultural group in Benue State, Iorbee Ihagh alleged that some Fulani killers were planning to take over the Tiv land and the entire country in the name of Jihad. Kanu, who had made similar revelation in the past, said he established the Eastern Security Network to defend Igboland and its people wherever they are settled in Nigeria. Recently, the Nigerian Defence Headquarters had deployed its men to the South-East region for 'Operation Restore Peace,' aimed at countering insecurity. While reacting, Kanu warned the Tivs people among security operatives in Nigeria to desist from being used against his people. "To those foolish and roundly idiotic Tivi men in the #Zoo Police, Army and DSS deployed to the East by #Fulani Caliphate murderers to engage #ESN, I have news for you. Your people in Tivi land are being sacked from their villages as you are busy doing Rambo in Biafraland. "I warned all of you that by the time you finish your tour of Biafraland, assuming you are still alive, the same #Fulani terrorists that sent you to my land would occupy yours in perpetuity. Your stupidity is costing your people dearly. Go back home, form a version of #ESN and defend your land against these vandals from the foothills of the Futa Jallon," Kanu said.
