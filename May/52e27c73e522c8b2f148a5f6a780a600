Bode George, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says excessive leakages of revenues and monumental corruption are responsible for slow growth in Lagos state.Speaking in an interview with Yoruba Tooto TV, George accused Bola Tinubu, national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) of taking N9 billion monthly from the Lagos state internally generated revenue account. Bola Tinubu “Do you know how much is Lagos state internally generated revenue monthly? N60 billion minimum, and someone (Tinubu) is sitting somewhere, taking 15 percent of it, that’s N9 billion every month,” he said. The former deputy national chairman of the PDP said the country’s electoral system is fraudulent. He said, “The way we vote in this country is a scam. That’s why I do say we need to be more prayerful and do good. It’s not who people voted for that are declared as winner. “How won’t issue of bullion van won’t be related to election? We are just deceiving ourselves. There is problem in this country, how can we move forward with this? “You can’t even force people now, they are angry, if you meet people now, they will tell you politicians are bad people, they should get away. Things are hard in this country.” George added that the late Funsho Williams should have become the Lagos state governor. “He is a good man, a very responsible one. He is like a brother to me, my junior then in school. He would have been a better governor of Lagos state,” he said. Williams, who was a governorahip aspirant in the state, was murdered in July 2006.
