Militants belonging to the Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād, have allegedly killed many Nigerians soldiers in Yobe State. According to the group in a statement sighted by SaharaReporters, the soldiers were killed recently during an ambush on Nigerian troops in Yunusari Local Government Area of the state.

The incident is coming a week after reports emerged that Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau had been killed or seriously wounded after trying to kill himself to avoid capture during clashes with its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP). Shekau’s Boko Haram faction and fighters from the ISWAP had been battling in northeastern Borno state. The groups have killed thousands and displaced millions in North-Eastern Nigeria. In the past few months, soldiers have been targeted by the insurgents. Scores of soldiers and officers have been reportedly killed since January 2021. At least 25 soldiers were recently killed when a suicide bomber identified as Abdullah al-Ansari rammed an explosives-laden pick-up truck into a military convoy during a clash in Goniri, a boarder community between Yobe and Borno states, killing many soldiers. In February, about 20 soldiers were also killed in Malari, Borno State by the insurgents. SaharaReporters gathered that the soldiers were on patrol to clear some Boko Haram elements in the area following a credible intelligence when they were ambushed by the group.
