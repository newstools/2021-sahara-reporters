President Muhammadu Buhari has said it will be difficult to efficiently manage a country or institution that is not secure. President Buhari said this when the Chairman, Presidential Council of Libya, His Excellency Mohammed Younis Menfi, paid him a visit at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. President Buhari The President emphasised that the security of Nigeria is the number one priority to him, noting that a stable or unstable Libya has implications for countries in the Lake Chad Basin area, including Nigeria. Buhari, in a statement through his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, said, “Republics of Chad, and Niger have extensive borders with Libya, and they are our immediate neighbours. Whatever affects them affects us. The stability or instability of Libya will directly affect us. “Unless a country or institution is secured, there’s no way you can efficiently manage it.” However, Mohammed Younis Menfi earlier revealed that Libya was fast evolving. According to him, it now has "one government active on the ground." "We are expelling the mercenaries, and unifying the instructions,” he added. Mohammed noted that the historical relationship between his country and Nigeria in the areas of oil and agriculture meant they have to cooperate with each other.
