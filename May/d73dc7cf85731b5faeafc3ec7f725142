The governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, has travelled out of the country. The development comes less than 24 hours after bandits abducted some schoolchildren from Salihu Tanko Islamic School in Rafi Local Government Area of the state. Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello SaharaReporters reported how the bandits invaded the school on Sunday evening. They were said to have arrived in their numbers on motorcycles and started shooting sporadically into the air. A source told SaharaReporters that one internally displaced person was shot dead while another was critically injured after gunmen carried out the kidnap operation around 4:30 pm on Sunday. In a statement on Monday, Mary Noel-Berje, chief press secretary to Bello, said the governor assured the state of the rescue and safe return of the students. She added that the governor is expected back in the country “within the shortest period”. “Governor Sani Bello also assured all Nigerlites that the government will continue to do all it can to protect the lives and property of its citizens while guaranteeing the continued peace and stability of the state,” she said. “While assuring the parents of the abducted children of their safe return as the security agencies have been directed to do all it can to bring back the children as soon as possible, the Governor also urged the citizens to cooperate and share intelligence and information that will help in the quick rescue of the children.”
