Gunmen, believed to be Fulani bandits, have attacked Suleja, a border area in Niger State, to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, killing three residents and abducting 12 others in Kwankwashe community in the Suleja Local Government Area of Niger State.  SaharaReporters learnt that one of the deceased was a middle-aged man, Nicholas Akhere, whose wife was also one of the 12 residents abducted by the attackers. File Photo Apart from Akhere, another resident and a six-year-old child were killed during the attack which occurred last week Wednesday.  Witnesses said the “gunmen reportedly broke into different houses in the community and whisked away residents who could not escape during the attack.”  Only on Monday, residents worried by the incessant abductions and attacks in the state had blocked the Gauraka end of the Abuja-Kaduna Highway in the Tarfa Local Government Area in hours-long protest.  The irate youths in their numbers had gone on rampage as early as 6:00am and barricaded the busy road with bonfire, stones and wood, insisting that nobody would pass until the government addressed the issue of insecurity in the area.  The residents were angered that bandits had been picking people up from house to house without any intervention by the security agents in the area.  Despite the presence of the military barracks – Zuma Barracks– in the area the residents said they were helpless and could not sleep well.  The protesters prevented vehicles from passing on the road.
