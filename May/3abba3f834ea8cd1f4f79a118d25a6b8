Gunmen numbering over twenty invaded Kuchiko Relocation Development Area in the Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory and abducted a resident and his son. According to a report by Daily Trust, the gunmen, stormed El-Rufaâ€™i Estate, in the early hours of Sunday and started shooting sporadically.  Having overpowered security guards on night duty, the gunmen, who also wielded knives and machetes, headed to the house of the victim (names withheld) and took him and his son hostage. There was panic among the residents of the estate, who were woken up by the staccato sound of gunshots. It was gathered that the invaders, who operated for an hour, later proceeded to the house of another resident and attempted to kidnap him. However, with the timely arrival of soldiers from the Defence College, Bwari, the situation was salvaged after a gun battle with the gunmen. Some residents of the area, who recounted their ordeals, called on the authorities to beef up security around the satellite areas. They also stated that the satellite towns in the FCT have been experiencing incidents of kidnapping for a while now, especially in Gwagwalada and Kuje area councils.
