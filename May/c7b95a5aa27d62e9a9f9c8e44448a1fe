 A mentally challenged woman has reportedly been set ablaze by hoodlums after she was allegedly caught with three AK-47 rifles at Abule-Ado, Trade fair area in Badagry, Lagos State. After retrieving the weapons from her, the woman was mercilessly beaten by the angry hoodlums before they set her ablaze.  According to an eyewitness who took the video, the unidentified woman had put the three sophisticated weapons in one of her bags and hid the bag to prevent people from seeing its contents. Residents claimed the woman who was said to be pretending to be mentally ill, was responsible for supplying weapons to armed robbers threatening the community. Meanwhile, when SaharaReporters contacted the Lagos State Police spokesperson, Muyiwa Adejobi, he said the police had not been briefed about the incident and had not received any reports to that effect.
