The Ghana Union of Traders Association has described as needless the ministerial delegation directed by President Muhammadu Buhari to be sent to Ghana to resolve the trade impasse between Ghana and Nigeria traders. According to the President of the Association, Dr Joseph Obeng, Ghana is only enforcing its trade laws and the country will not relent on that.  In an interview with GhanaWeb, he said, "Their coming here is needless. Their speaker came to Ghana and understood that Ghana is not doing anything badly against their citizens and only enforcing its laws. We will not relent on the pressure we are giving to the government to enforce the laws that are made for the people of Ghana." Obeng further accused the Nigerian government of not respecting the trade laws of Ghana. "Their coming here even suggests that they do not respect the sovereignty of Ghana for us to even apply our laws. It is not fair for a country, the calibre of Nigeria, to do that, knowing the ethics of governance. It's not fair," he stated. "We are a sovereign country for Christ's sake and we have our laws. Our laws don't breach any international laws, so what are they trying to say?" Nigeria Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Niyi Adebayo on Monday announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed that a ministerial delegation be sent to Ghana to resolve the lingering conflict between Nigerian traders and Ghanaian authorities." Adebayo said he would be leading the delegation to Ghana, adding that members of the delegation "will also engage in further dialogue with Ghanaian authorities to find a lasting solution to the problem." He pointed out that the delegation is expected to embark on this visit to Ghana between May 31 and June 1, 2021.
