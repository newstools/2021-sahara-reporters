Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has said his decision to defect from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress is to help decrease the level of tension in the country. He described the defection as nationalistic.  The governor declared this on Thursday during in a live broadcast on Channels Television. Expressing his excitement over his defection, Ayade called on other politicians to help tackle the challenges facing the country "This is the time I think I need to move to the centre... the choice to join the APC was based on a nationalistic approach. "I have offered myself to the government at the centre and encouraged others to join too in helping the country tackle its challenges. "I feel so happy to be in APC. PDP stood by me, gave me the opportunity to be a Senator.... My choice to join the APC is to help reduce the tension in Nigeria. More governors will join the APC," he said. This morning, I formally joined the All Progressives Congress. This decision was borne out of the need to bring Cross River State in sync with the policies and programs of the federal government.
