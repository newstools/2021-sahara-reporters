Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju Omiyinka, (Baba Ijesha), had once predicted his current predicament in 'Ilu Awon Obirin', a movie featured in. The embattled actor was caught molesting a minor, who happened to be the foster child of comedienne, Adekola Adekanya, aka Princess.  He was thereafter arrested by the police and many Nigerians have lambasted the actor over molesting the victim. Video clips had surfaced on the internet to prove he actually perpetuated the act.

In the film, the actor acted as a randy man who eventually got into trouble over his philandering ways, Punch reports. While suffering the consequences of his actions in the movie, he gave some advice to his co-actor who had also got into trouble like him. The co-actor asked, “What got you into this?” Baba Ijesa then responded, “I am an incurable adulterer. Where I come from, no one is as good at lying as me. No woman has ever caught me. My nickname, ‘Ololomasun’ is the alias for adulterous men. However, God caught me red-handed. It was through some ladies I was fornicating with that I got struck with a charm. “I was then rushed to a benevolent pastor. I was prayed for and I got well. After I was healed, the pastor told me to go home to my family. Though I have a wife, I always lied to women that I was not married and I didn’t have children. After leaving the pastor on the seventh day, I was riding along in my car and I saw a pretty lady swaying her hips along the road. I thought I would make her my last catch before I stopped finally. I did not know I had cursed myself. I just wanted to have a taste of her and run, not knowing that I had entered the trap.”
