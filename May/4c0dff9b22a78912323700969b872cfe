The Northern Elders Forum has joined Nigerians in the call for President Muhammadu Buhari’s impeachment following his inability to solve Nigeria’s insecurity challenges.  Speaking during an interview on AIT on Monday morning, the NEF spokesman, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said the nation could not wait two more years for Buhari to address the issues of insecurity.  He noted that those who had the constitutional responsibility to protect Nigeria must realise that the country was in a dire state and do something other than making promises.  He said the second option is for citizens to get together and decide to do something.  “The third option is that those leaders who are failing will recognise the fact that they are the problem and resign because they clearly have nothing to offer in terms of leadership.  “As our democratic system provides, those with the responsibility to get them off should impeach those who are failing. If the president can’t deliver, he should be impeached.  “We don’t have a National Assembly that appears to have the level of patriotism and concern beyond partisan politics to realise that when this roof falls, it also falls on their heads.  “Partisanship is so pronounced that the people we elected and sent to Abuja think they serve the President rather than the Nigerian people,” he said.
