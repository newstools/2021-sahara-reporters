I dropped every little respect I had for you the moment you said it! @yomifabiyi I pray karma visits you!  Fabiyi had earlier warned his colleagues not to be in a hurry to crucify Baba Ijesha. He added that before they castigate their colleague, they should ensure that law enforcement officers had done their investigation. In another post, he said his colleagues should allow the court to decide if Baba Ijesha was guilty. He further mentioned that many people were not privy to the CCTV video or the suspect’s confession. But following the release of the footage on Sunday, Fabiyi shifted the blame to the victim's guardians, who he said used the victim as bait to be molested do they could apprehend Baba Ijesha. Efforts to reach Fabiyi were however not successful as he didn't answer his calls not reply text messages sent to his mobile line.
