The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, says he can’t be held responsible for the fraudulent actions of his Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties, Abidemi Rufai. SaharaReporters had reported how the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Rufai at the John F Kennedy International Airport in New York for alleged involvement in $350,000 unemployment fraud.  Abiodun’s Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, in a statement said the news of his aide’s involvement in fraud is disturbing. The statement read, “We received the very disturbing news of the arrest of one of the governor’s political appointees, Mr Abidemi Rufai in New York over alleged unemployment benefits and fraud in the United States, this morning.

Abiodun remains committed to his agenda of building our future together and will not condone criminals either in his government or the state in general.”
