According to him, cattle rearing has been in Africa for over 100 years without any consideration to the free movement of cattle (open grazing) or any grazing reserve, Daily Trust reports. He said open grazing was carried out at that time because there were few herders, farmers and cattle, especially in Nigeria, stressing that currently, the population had increased with modern technique of farming consuming land tremendously. Jibrin, who is also the Sarkin Fulani Nasarawa, said, with the current concern on cattle rearing in Africa, especially Nigeria, there is a need to look at how best this practice will be carried out successfully.
