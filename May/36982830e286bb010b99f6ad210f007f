Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai has sack of all nurses in the state below Grade Level 14 and lecturers of the Kaduna State University (KASU) for joining the ongoing warning strike. The warning strike is for five days and it is to push the state government to reverse its decision to sack thousands of workers. Kaduna State Governor Nasiru Ahmed El-Rufai El-Rufai also likened the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) leaders who coordinated the ongoing strike and shutdown of the state to bandits. Kaduna is one of the northern states most affected by banditry, who kill, rape and kidnap residents, including students from their schools. El-Rufai had earlier declared the National President of the NLC, Ayuba Wabba and other labour leaders wanted for "economic sabotage" following the strike.
