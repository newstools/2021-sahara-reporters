Gunmen suspected to be bandits have attacked Beri town in the Bobi district of Niger state, burning down a police station and killing no fewer than 13 people, including a police officer. The Niger State Emergency Management Agency disclosed this in a memo on Monday.  According to the emergency agency, the attack left several people injured. The bandits also attacked Unguwan Malam Bako in Kotonkoro district and abducted an unconfirmed number of people, the agency added. The agency listed the names of the deceased as: Idris Ahmed Kwata, Hadiza Umaru Tunga, Momi Dalladi, Ibrahim Dalkadi, Yau Dalladi, Saadiya Garba, Garba Umar Tashanjirgi, Hussaini Shuaib, Ayuba Garba, Abdullahi Jodi, Alhaji Isah Kasakohi and Fatima Nasiru Kwata. Niger state, the largest in the country, is one of the worst affected states by banditry across the country. In a statement on Sunday, Niger state Governor Abubakar Bello described the state of insecurity as a “war situation.” “The situation has reached crisis level; in fact, it’s a war situation that we have to confront without further delay,” he said.
