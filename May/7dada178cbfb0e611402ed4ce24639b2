The wife of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Folu Adeboye, says Nigeria is going through a siege, and believers should weep in prayer for the country. Also known as Mother-In-Israel, Mrs Adeboye, who has been married to Pastor Enoch Adeboye for over 50 years, on Friday night, led prayers for Nigeria on Friday night.  The session lasted up to 30 minutes. She ministered at the May Edition of the church’s Holy Ghost Service. The programme was themed, “Overflowing Blessings.” Mrs Adeboye said, “Brethren, today’s prayer is going to be different because there is always a purpose for a season because the Bible tells us in Ecclesiastes Chapter 3 that there is a purpose for the season. The season that we are in Nigeria now calls for a lot of prayers. “Our nation, Nigeria, is going through a siege, and it is so much, so hard and we want God to liberate us even as we connect to other nations and believe that our prayers for Nigeria, God Himself will allow it to reach other countries and other nations will get out of every form of siege that they are going through. “These prayers, if you need to weep, you better weep because weeping may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning. This is the time we need to cry. It is becoming overwhelming, it is too much, people are dying every day from hunger, people are dying every day from all kinds of terrorism, and people are dying from kidnapping.” The Adeboye’s third child, Pastor Dare Adeboye, died on Wednesday in Eket, Akwa Ibom State, where he was based with his family. The death of the 42-year-old pastor shocked the world as well-meaning persons, including presidents, governors, and personalities, condoling the 79-year-old general overseer and his wife over the death of their son. The general overseer of the church, which is one of the largest churches in the world, had also preached on Thursday night during the Holy Communion Service of the monthly programme.
