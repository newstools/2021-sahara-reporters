Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu The Governor EMERITUS OF LAGOS STATE Dear Sir, It amazes me that, you had the audacity and effrontery, to have issued a purported statement, wherein you claimed to be ACTING AND SPOKE ON BEHALF OF THE YORUBA’S Sir, in what capacity? Under which authority? Is it in your capacity as a member of APC OR AS A YORUBA SPOKESMAN? I, Olalekan Olarewaju; hereby put it to you, that you have not spoken on my behalf, because there was never a time I gave you the CONSENT. Be that as it may, you and your DEVILISH PARTY MEN ARE NOT THE TRUE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE YORUBA’S. Your antecedents clearly showed that you are; A pathological liar A selfish human being A self centered, arrogant opportunist A master forger, whose birthday, school attended are shrouded in controversies You are not entitled to represent THE YORUBAS BECAUSE YOU DO NOT POSSESS THE MORAL CHARACTER I will end my letter to you, by advising you to sue me to COURT, since all the JUDGES IN LAGOS STATE, your privately run company are employed by you. TI ILE BA TO RO, OMO ALE IBE KOI TI DAGBA NIYEN. Meantime, I remain, Sincerely yours, Olalekan Olarewaju, Esq. LL.B(Hons.), BL
