The Nigerian Bar Association, Benin Branch, Edo State has called for the immediate removal of the Divisional Police Officer, Etete Police Division Benin City, Adesuwa Omoruyi, and some other officers for alleged extortion and harassment of citizens in the area. The association accused the DPO of turning the station into a cash cow and extorting the residents with impunity, thereby causing gridlock and accidents on the road. File photo used to illustrate story. A statement issued and signed by the legal adviser of the association, Gavin Daudu, on Thursday claimed the DPO allegedly damaged the side mirror of the car of the Vice Chairman of the association, Bar Mrs Paul Agbale, in an attempt to extort money from her. The NBA expressed worry over the unprofessional conduct and activities of the officer. The statement read, "On May 13, 2021, in attempt to extort money from the Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association, Benin Branch, Mrs Paul Agbale, one ASP Ebenezer Oru, maliciously damaged the side mirror of her car, without any provocation. "The Benin Bar is worried that the already battered image of the Nigerian Police is further brought to the fore by the activities of the Etete Police Division, as the station has continually engaged in illegal traffic causing roadblocks, while collecting money from vulnerable citizens who ply the Etete Road, in GRA, Benin City. "We hereby call on the Commissioner of Police, Edo State, who has been a supportive partner with the Bar in the fight against corruption, to remove the DPO, Etete Police Station, Adesuwa Omoruyi." The statement said the body had been inundated with complaints of extortion of huge amounts of money from citizens at night around the station after the curfew period. The association also called for the redeployment of Divisional Crime Officer ( DCO ) Oru Ebenezer and Osas Imariagbe for pointing guns at the chairman of the association while making an effort to intervene in the matter.
