Buba Galadima, a chieftain on the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) and estranged friend of President Muhammadu Buhari, has described those condeming Father Ejike Mbaka, the Spiritual Leader of Adoration Ministry, over his call for the President's impeachment as ingrates. Galadima noted that nobody in the Presidency condemned the Catholic priest when he was praising and campaigning for Buhari. Reverend Father Ejike Mbaka The cleric had called for Buhari’s resignation, saying he failed to solve the problem of insecurity across the country. Mbaka, who lamented the current security and economic situation ravaging the entire nation, urged the National Assembly to impeach the President if he fails to resign. But presidential aide, Garba Shehu, accused Mbaka of feeling slighted because he tried to get contracts under the Buhari government as reward for his support for the administration and failed. But Galadima in an interview with Daily Post, said: “First time one needs to hear about the truth is when friends part ways and those attacking Mbaka from the side of the government should be faulted. “Where were they when Mbaka was campaigning for the President? What was their public contribution to the success of the President more than Mbaka? "So Mbaka should have the freedom to speak his mind when things are not going the way he presumes they should go. This is a democracy, and it’s his personal opinion; it was his subjective opinion to campaign and work for Gen Buhari to become President and everybody was hailing him then; these people were never there. “So, today, because they have surrounded Buhari and he doesn’t know what is happening around him, they are attacking Mbaka. "They are a bunch of ingrates biting the hand that fed them.”
