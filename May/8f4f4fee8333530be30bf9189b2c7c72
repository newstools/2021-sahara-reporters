Officials of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria, JUSUN, have barred journalists from entering the Supreme Court premises to cover the judgement in the appeal filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its chieftain, Wilson Edobor against Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki. The officials blocked the main gate of the apex court against newsmen on the grounds that reporting the proceedings will sabotage their nationwide strike. SaharaReporters Media It was gathered that lawyers, politicians and litigants were however, allowed into the court premises. The judgement was scheduled to be delivered by 4 pm and when journalists arrived, JUSUN members at the gate denied them entry. As at the time of filing this report, the judgement had yet to commence. The Court of Appeal in Abuja last March dismissed the certificate forgery case brought against Obaseki by the APC and one of its members, Edobor.
