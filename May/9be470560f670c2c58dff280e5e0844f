4 Hours Ago It was at this point the female officer mobilised some officers and drove close to Sowore and his group, before shooting at him. Sowore, who was holding an iron net put around the fountain screamed in pain and went down. Blood gushed out of the wound. Speaking to SaharaReporters, his lawyer, Abubakar Marshal who was also at the protest described the shooting of unarmed protesters as callous, wicked and unwarranted. Marshal said, "Comrade gathered at Unity Fountain this morning in furtherance of the protest slated for today. When we got to the Unity Fountain, we discovered that the gate had been locked and we inquired from the policemen on the ground. We were informed that there was an order from the Commissioner of Police, FCT to lock the gate. "We put a call to the Commissioner of Police and he denied that he gave such an order and he promised to order his men to open the gate in the next two minutes so that we could have access to the fountain, a public utility.
