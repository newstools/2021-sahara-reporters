A Nollywood actress, Ify Onwuemene, has reportedly died of Endometrial cancer. One of her colleagues, Gloria Anozie-Young disclosed this on her Facebook page.  Anozie-Young stated that Onwuemene had been battling with the ailment for many years and spent a huge amount of money. Ify, who was famed for her role in the popular sitcom ‘Everyday People’, passed away on Tuesday after battling endometrial cancer. Anozie-Young wrote, “With a deep sense of loss but total submission to God Almighty, we regret to announce that Ifey Onwuemene has gone to be with the Lord. “Ify Onwuemene was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Her womb was removed, but she has been battling the ailment for many years now.“In 2019, even after eight sessions of chemotherapy, the doctors told her she had reached stage 4. However, we are not sure if she was given the wrong diagnosis or being treated with the wrong chemo, because she still felt pains on her upper abdomen and her tummy was bloated. “Ify spent more than N10 million, being helped with donations by her fellow actors and other Nigerians. A GoFundMe account was opened for her, but it did not yield much. She had to go for draining every two weeks at a cost of N280,000, but only 3 litres of liquid can be removed at a time so that her heart is not affected.“Ify has finally gone to rest, today 25th May 2021. May her soul rest in perfect peace. Amen.” Anozie-Young stated that burial arrangements would be released by the family of the deceased.
