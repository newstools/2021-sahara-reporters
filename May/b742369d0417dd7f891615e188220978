EFCC Bawa noted that there were a lot of leakages that needed to be blocked, adding that it was not about generating revenue. He said, "We recovered over a billion (naira) from (a) civil servant sitting in an account last week. “After observing the proceedings and the process of investigation of the Clcommittee, I am happy with what is happening here. It is a good development that the committee is working towards blocking revenue leakages. "At this point in the nation’s history, it is not much about generating revenue as much as blocking leakages of revenue generated and still being generated by all these agencies of government.”
