The new Chief of Army Staff, Major General Farouk Yahaya, resumed office on Friday at the Nigerian Army headquarters, Abuja, just as the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Lucky Irabor, urged him to tackle insurgency and banditry headlong. Irabor played host to the new Chief of Army Staff in his office, at the Defence Headquarters, Abuja.  According to a release from the DHQ, Irabor said Yahaya’s appointment as the 22nd COAS “was well deserved.” “The CDS wished him a successful tenure in office as he assumes command. General Irabor further urged the new COAS to build on the legacy of his predecessor, particularly in the fight against insurgency and banditry. “The COAS was accompanied on the visit by the Chief of Policy and Plans Headquarters Nigerian Army, Maj Gen Benjamin Ahanotu. Highlight of the visit was the CDS' presentation of Nigerian Army flag to the new COAS,” the statement partly reads. Yahaya’s resumption comes a week after the former Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Ibrahim Attahiru, died alongside 10 other army officers in a plane crash in Kaduna State. They were buried last Saturday at the National Military Cemetery in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Attahiru died in a Nigerian Air Force Beechcraft 350 aircraft crash at the Kaduna State International Airport while attending an official assignment on Friday. There was no survivor on the plane. The Nigerian Air Force said it had launch an investigation into the cause of the crash of its NAF aircraft in which Attahiru was killed last Friday.
