The Nigerian Labour Congress says it is committed to dialogue and social bargaining to benefit disengaged Kaduna workers. The Kaduna NLC Chairman, Ayuba Magaji, revealed this on Tuesday in Kaduna on the second day of protest against Governor Nasir El-Rufai's administration to reverse the mass sacking of its workers. Kaduna State Governor, Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai Magaji stated in a report by the News Agency of Nigeria, "We are not in a military regime. It is not an issue of stubbornness. We will protect the rights of workers to the letter. "The Kaduna state government is playing tough on our actions. We have had military governments who are tough by nature, but we sat down and had a dialogue with them and reached a logical conclusion." He added, "We are equally taking our responsibilities as workers' representatives and bringing to the open the grievances of our workers. "It is a straightforward issue, let the Kaduna state government reinstate the disengaged workers, and they should not sack the 11,000 they are planning to, and we will call off our action. "The state government doesn't need toughness to discuss this. This is a democratic regime; even in military regimes, labour unions strive. We will continue with our struggle." Meanwhile, banks, fuel stations, hospitals, among others, have remained locked.
