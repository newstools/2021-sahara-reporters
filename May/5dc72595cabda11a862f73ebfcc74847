He said: “I apologise to everybody that I have offended in one way or the other. Please, I’m a human being. I’m bound to make mistakes. I was triggered by the zeal and passion in me. As a human being, even computers tend to malfunction, there is blood flowing in my veins, I tend to get emotional sometimes.  “Whenever I do anything out-of-control on the basis of emotions, I always apologise when I realise it and correct the mistakes. For those disappointed in me, please forgive me. For those I have offended, please find a place in your heart to forgive me. I’m only but a human being.  “I know some people will say that there is nobody that sent him to do human rights work, forgetting that government organisations that are supposed to get justice for ordinary Nigerians are not doing their work.”
