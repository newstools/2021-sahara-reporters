SaharaReporters learnt the incident happened around 10.00 pm on Sunday. A source close to the family said the woman was driving in front of her husband, Mr. Salawu and when she was about to open their house gate, the gunmen attacked her and whisked her away in a Nissan Micra car. ”They were both coming home. She was driving in front while the husband was driving behind. As she alighted to open the gate of the house, the kidnappers surfaced, brandishing guns and other dangerous objects. They kidnapped the wife in the process. That was around 10.00 pm last night,” a close associate of the family who spole on condition of anonymity said. As at the time of filing report on Monday morning, the gunmen had not contacted any of the family members, our source said. Efforts to get the police public relations officer, Adewale Osifeso proved abortive as he did not answer calls to his mobile line or reply the text message sent to him.
