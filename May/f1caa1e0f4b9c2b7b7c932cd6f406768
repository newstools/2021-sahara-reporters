The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and a pro-independence movement in western Cameroon, Ambazonia Governing Council (AGovC), have agreed to exchange weapons and personnel to help them achieve their similar goals — freedom. The IPOB was created by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, who has over the years, condemned the Nigerian government for its poor investment, inequitable resource distribution, marginalisation, and heavy military presence in the region.  The group, therefore, demanded secession and the restoration of an independent state of Biafra in the South-East through an independence referendum. On its part, AGovC fights to carve out Cameroon’s English-speaking Northwest and Southwest regions into a breakaway state called Ambazonia. The grievances of Anglophone Cameroonians date back to 1961 when the region was granted independence from Britain. However, forming an alliance with each other, Foreign Policy, an American news publication, said: “The scope of the alliance will include joint operations and training bases, Capo Daniel, the deputy defence chief of the Ambazonia Defense Forces, the military wing of the Ambazonia Governing Council said. “The groups will work to secure their shared border and ensure an open exchange of weapons and personnel, representatives of both the Ambazonia and IPOB movements.” According to a Vanguard report, Emma Powerful was quoted as saying: “It’s true. We are growing day by day. We need to strengthen ourselves.”
