A military operative identified as Stephen has allegedly killed a yet-to-be identified car owner in Akwa Ibom. According to a Facebook user, Mbet Okpongete, the soldier had met the deceased at Eleme Junction in Port Harcourt, Rivers state and begged him for a lift to Ikot Abasi in Akwa Ibom state.  He was said to have shot him dead during the journey. “The owner of this car was shot dead in his car on his way to Uyo by a military man he gave a ride yesterday from Eleme junction in Port Harcourt to Ikot Abasi in Akwa Ibom state. “He thought this military man will help him through all the multiple checkpoints along Ogoni Road, I guess. The army man never knew this car was tracked, a device that was duly activated by security operatives and he was picked up at one hotel in Ukanafun LGA this morning. “The military hierarchy was at the state police headquarters today to pick him up for firstly, a court-martial before handing him over to the police for prosecution. “I witnessed this process at Ikot Akpan Abia police headquarters today. We need to be circumspect as we give lift to not just security men on the road but just anybody. Some sad stuff, isn't it,” Okpongete posted. Speaking to SaharaReporters, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Akwa Ibom Command, Odiko MacDon said, “The report is coming in and we are looking at it, I am yet to get the update. When we get the update, we will release it to members of the public.”
