Lagos State Ministry of Environment and Water Resources has reportedly terminated the appointment of one Mr. Toyemej Joseph Juwonlo for disclosing his salary. It was learnt that the Ministry had engaged the master's degree holder to clean drainages in the Ikotun area of Lagos state with N35,000 as monthly salary.  According to P.M.EXPRESS, Joseph was sacked after he revealed his monthly salary as a drainage cleaner, which was hitherto kept secret within the Ministry. The Lagos State University (LASU) graduate was sacked after the conditions of service were made public and Governor Sanwo-Olu was briefed about the situation. It was learnt that the governor questioned the ministry officials and demanded to know why he was engaged with such a ridiculous salary. The 49-year old Juwonlo who studied Banking and Finance as first degree before he went for his master's degree in Business Financing, started the work in April 2021. He had to trek from his house at Meiran area to Ikotun every morning to work after the Lagos State Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources engaged him as Drainage Supervisor, which requires cleaning gutters at the Ikotun axis. Meanwhile it was said that Juwonlo was engaged without any appointment letter and condition of the work he was employed to do.
