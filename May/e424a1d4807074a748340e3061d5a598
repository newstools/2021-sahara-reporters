There was tension on Saturday in Idi-Iroko in the Ipokia Local Government Area of Ogun State when some Yoruba Nation agitators stormed the area in a bid to open the land border. But, operatives of the Nigeria Customs Service manning the border areas repelled the attack.  The land border had been closed by the Federal Government since 2019 when it directed that all forms of importation be done through the seaports. According to Daily Trust, the agitators on Saturday invaded the border community and forced open all the gates at the international frontier. A viral video posted on social media showed a gun being snatched from an Immigration officer. When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the Nigeria Customs Service Ogun 1 Area Command, Hammed Oloyede confirmed the incident. This is the first time the agitators have acted violently.
