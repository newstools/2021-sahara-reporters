The statement reads in part, "The aforementioned people, our feeler from the Fulani community in Oke-Ogun and Ibarapa hinted that they were dissatisfied over the plan to remove the embattled Serkin Fulani Alhaji Abdulkadir Saliu by some Fulanis in Oyo state. "Therefore their plans, if successful, may lead to ethnic conflicts that can lead to civil unrest and breakdown of law and order. The source therefore called on the Oyo state government to beam its searchlight henceforth on Ibarapa, Oke-Ogun in particular and Oyo state in general as well as place aforementioned names on their watchlist."
