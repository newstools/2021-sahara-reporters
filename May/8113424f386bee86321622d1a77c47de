The Arewa Consultative Forum has urged the Kaduna State Government and Nigeria Labour Congress to resolve their differences. In a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe, the forum said the strike action by the NLC has crippled activities in the state.  ACF suggested that the Kaduna State Government should give more time to those marked for lay-off to make sure they acquire new skills before they get sacked. Yawe said, “For two days now the activities of the Kaduna state government have been crippled by a strike called by the Nigeria Labour Congress. “Hospitals, electricity/water services, the airport, the road/rail transport and many other services in the state have been crippled. “The National President of Nigeria Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba said there is no going back on the strike until the government follows the law in dealing with workers in the state. Labour is particularly angry with the state government over the massive lay-off of civil servants in the state.

1 Day Ago “The ACF advises the Kaduna state government to reconsider its decision particularly on downsizing the workforce in the state's services. We suggest that as a way out, maybe those earlier marked for lay-off should be given some more time to make sure they acquire new and/or additional skills. The Labour should also reconsider their stand. “Their displeasure and point against the Kaduna state government have gone on record. Nigeria is already faced with so many problems that a strike action that has crippled the strategically located town of Kaduna for days running will only make things worse for the ordinary man.”
