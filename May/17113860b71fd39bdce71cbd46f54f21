The Supreme Court on Friday upheld an earlier judgment of the Court of Appeal which okayed the deregistration of National Unity Party and 73 others. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) last year deregistered the political parties over their inability to win any election during the 2019 general elections.

INEC had deregistered the political parties, meaning that they would not be participating in subsequent elections in the country. INEC chairman, Yakubu Mahmood recently said the action was in preparation for the coming 2023 general elections. According to him, the deregistration was done because of the poor performance of the parties in the 2019 general elections. He also said the 74 political parties failed to satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Alteration to the Constitutional Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).
