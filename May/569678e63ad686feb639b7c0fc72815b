A group called World Igbo Congress has asked Nigerians in the southern region and Middle Belt to participate in sit-at-home memorials to honour Biafra fallen heroes, the late Chief MKO Abiola and the late Major Gideon Orkar. The group also appealed to Nigerians from these areas to boycott the cow meat on May 30, June 12 and July 27 as part of sacrificial rites given to their brave heroes.  This was disclosed in a statement released by Barrister Austin Okeke to SaharaReporters on Tuesday. The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu had earlier ordered members and people of the South-East to withdraw from any social, political and economic activities in the country on May 31, as a tribute to their brave fallen heroes. In the statement, WIC said, "All Biafrans around the world, remember Biafra heroes on Sunday, 30 May, 2021 by 2 pm Biafra Time. "Please, join us to remember, respect and acknowledge their generous sacrifices. "Solidarity sit-at-home on May 30 Biafra Genocide Memorial, June 12 MKO Abiola Memorial Day and July 27 Gideon Orkar Memorial Day. "Southern and Middle Belt indigenous Nigerians, sit-at-home on the above dates and boycott Fulani cow meat," the statement read. It also announced that there will be a conference on Sunday, 30 where Third Republic Governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife and IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, among others are guest speakers.
