The Lagos Police Command has maintained silence despite reports of soldiers harassment against residents and passersby in Oshodi, a suburb of the state. SaharaReporters had attempted to reach out to the Command's spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi but he was not available for comments as of the time of filing this report. File photo used to illustrate story. He neither responded to calls nor replied to a text message sent. Police have also been unable to restore calm to the area, according to residents. According to a report by Daily Trust, many residents and passengers are currently stranded in the area as soldiers have taken over major places in the area. It was stated that military personnel stormed the area on Thursday morning to avenge the death of an officer of the Nigerian Air Force, who was allegedly mobbed to death by hoodlums. Many vehicles, especially commercial buses have been destroyed, while some persons were assaulted by the aggrieved security operatives. Some residents heading to work were trapped in the ensuing violence while students returned home. Traders cleaning up their stores on the day of the weekly sanitation also fled just as some transporters abandoned their vehicles. Soldiers targeting hoodlums could be seen marching across the streets. The situation, it was gathered, has compounded traffic congestion in the city, affecting movements in and out of the part of Oshodi where the rampaging soldiers are. Oshodi links other major parts of Lagos and a major bus terminal is in that part of the state.
