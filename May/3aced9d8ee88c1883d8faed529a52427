Few hours after 15 persons were kidnapped at Gauraka in the Tafa Local Government of Niger state, two suspected kidnappers were burnt alive by a mob in Madalla area of Suleja Local Government Area of the state. Madalla is a few kilometers from Gauraka. The incident occurred on Monday, May 24.  According to eyewitnesses, the suspected bandits were about to escape when the people in the area rounded them up and set them on fire, using petrol and used tyres. It could not be confirmed if there was any link between the Gauraka kidnap incident and the burnt suspected kidnappers. Gunmen suspected to be bandits had on Monday morning stormed Gauraka town, kidnapping no less than 15 residents. The heavily armed bandits shot sporadically as they went from house to house kidnapping their victims and taking them to unknown destination. Following the development hundreds of youths and other villagers poured out on the road blocking the ever busy Abuja- Sulejaâ€“Kaduna Road and preventing free flow of traffic on both sides of the road.
