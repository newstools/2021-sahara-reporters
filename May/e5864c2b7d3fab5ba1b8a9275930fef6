Ibrahim Attahiru who died in a plane crash while on official assignment in Kaduna State alongside 10 other military officers; “It is with grave dissatisfaction to have our finest military officers killed. We sympathise with the families of our fallen heroes and pray for the almighty God to console and be with the families in this trying time. We would require the military to activate a full-scale investigation into the crash and the actual cause of death As soon as possible.” “On this note, we would be calling off our planned protests in line with our ultimatum issued 28 days ago to mourn our fallen heroes.
