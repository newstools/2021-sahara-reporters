Nigerians on Tuesday protested in Paris, the French Capital where President Muhammadu Buhari is attending the Africa Finance Summit on a four-day visit. The Nigerians who carried the #HarassBuhariOutofParis placards lamented that Buhari had failed the country and his government had been characterised by bad governance, bloodshed, killings and poor policies.  Some of the placards read, “Innocent Nigerians are dying daily”, “Buhari government has failed Nigerians” and “Harass Buhari out of Paris.” “You have to go back to Nigeria. Paris cannot be for you. There are hunger, insecurity and kidnappings in Nigeria. People are suffering. And you are here to come and relax. Go and fix Nigeria. You have failed Nigerians,” one of the protesters screamed. “Go back and fix the hospitals. Make the environment conducive. People are dying every day,” another person said. “Buhari, what kind of a president leaves his country and comes to take refuge in another country? We are living in another man’s land because our country is not good. Look at me; I am a refugee in this country. I cannot go back to my own country. You have failed Nigerians,” a female protester lamented. “Can you imagine Benjamin @Netanyahu leaving Israel for a summit in France, when his country is on fire? Yet, more people were killed by terrorists and bandits in Nigeria last week, than in the ongoing Israel Palestine conflict. This is why we convened #HarassBuhariOutofParis,” said Reno Omokri, former President Goodluck Jonathan’s aide, who is one of those who organised the protest. SaharaReporters had on Tuesday reported that some Nigerians staying in South American countries and other European countries were to hold the #HarassBuhariOutofParis. A Nigerian had confirmed he was flying in from Rio De Janeiro from Brazil into Paris for the protest while others were joining in from other European countries close to France. On Monday, Omokri called for the #HarassBuhariOutofParis protest in the wake of Buhari leaving Nigeria for Paris on Sunday to attend the African Finance Summit. The protesting Nigerians are angry that President Buhari left the chaotic state of Nigeria burning with insecurity and failed leadership, to attend the Africa Finance Summit In Paris, France for four days. “Get ready to join us today for #HarassBuhariOutofParis by 12 noon Paris time, at the Temporary Exhibition Centre, front of the Eiffel Tower. Buhari can’t be globetrotting, while Nigeria is drifting. He should back and fix Nigeria! And if he can’t do it, let him honourably resign “This made my day. This is a patriot. Flying all the way from Rio de Janeiro to join the #HarassBuhariOutofParis protest tomorrow, 12 noon, at the Temporary Exhibition Centre, at the Eiffel Tower. @MBuhari can’t be globetrotting, while Nigeria is drifting. Go back and fix Nigeria,” Omokri had said on Twitter on Tuesday morning. On April 2, a crowd of Nigerians in the United Kingdom had also stormed the Abuja House, 2 Campden Hill, Kensington, London, demanding that President Buhari, then on medical leave, immediately return home.#HarassBuhariOutOfLondon had trended after the president departed Nigeria for the UK to undergo a medical check-up. Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, had also advised Nigerians in the UK to occupy the London hospital where President Buhari planned to have his medical checkup.
