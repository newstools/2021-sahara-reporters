A street trader was on Wednesday crushed to death by an unidentified driver at the Ile-Epo axis of Lagos state. The yet-to-be-identified man was reportedly found lying in the middle of the road after he was run over by the driver.  His wares (bottled water and soft drinks) and an umbrella were placed beside his lifeless body with visible stains of blood on his trousers. Efforts to reach the police spokesman for Lagos State, Muyiwa Adejobi, were futile as calls and text messages to his phone lines were not responded to. SaharaReporters observed that hit-and-run accidents in Nigeria hardly get reported in the media and the victims rarely get justice though such occurrences occur regularly.
