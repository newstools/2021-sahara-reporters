The Special Adviser to Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Labour Affairs, Comrade Bayo Titilola Sodo has said it is wrong for the Kaduna State governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai to sack thousands of workers in the state.  El-Rufai had proposed to sack thousands of workers in the state, a situation that has led to a five-day industrial strike and protests by workers.  The Kaduna State governor on Tuesday also announced the sacking of nurses and lecturers who joined in the strike action.  But Sodo, the immediate past Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in Oyo State, told journalists in Ibadan on Wednesday that it was wrong for El-Rufai to sack workers without due process.  “I am with NLC, you cannot just wake up one day and say that you are sacking the workers.  “It is about the government. It is not about El-Rufai and sons. It is the Kaduna State government. Due process must be followed.  “I see myself as a representative of labour in the government of Governor Seyi Makinde. I see myself as the ears and eyes of the labour. I take responsibility for whatever mistake the governor may have made.”  Sodo also disclosed that Oyo State Government pays N30,500 minimum wage to its workers.  “Some wrongly dismissed workers have been reinstated back to the service. The minimum wage in Oyo State is N30,500 and I can say that if not for COVID-19, it would be more than that.  “The government has paid over N13 billion across sectors to pensioners in the state and it has increased the maternity leave to six (6) months," he added.
