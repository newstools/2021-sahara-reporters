The Managing Director of Zamfara State Transport Authority (ZAROTA), Aliyu Alhazzai Shinkafi has physically attacked a driver, Abdulrasheed Buhari Yandi for criticising the Bello Mohammed Matawalle-led government in the state.  SaharaReporters gathered that Yandi had in a Facebook post on May 12 expressed disappointment over what he called lack of significant infrastructural projects in the state.  He also accused the governor of paying much attention to maintaining a glamorous appearance, rather than governance.  “PDP (Peoples Democratic Party) is ours and our desire is its progress, but I am disappointed with Matawalle. Honestly I am so disappointed when I came to Zamfara; there is nothing developmental that I saw in Gusau and the entire Zamfara,” Yandi wrote.  “Matawalle promised to build Gusau Hotel in three months but there is nothing yet; he said he will build Ruga in one year, it is yet to materialise. Cargo airport is yet to take off. There is nothing significant in terms of security.”  Angry with the Facebook post, Shinkafi went to work in search of young man.
