Shehu, said the fugitive’s relationship with the President’s daughter ended years ago. “It is, therefore, unfortunate to bring the President’s family into this case. It is, in our view, an attempt to generate views and sell copies of sensational reporting. “The President’s position at all times is that the law be allowed to take its course.
