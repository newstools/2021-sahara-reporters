Ahmad Isah, human rights activist and broadcast journalist, Ahmad Isah has blamed his short-temper for his physical assault on people in the course of doing his work. His radio station’s license was suspended last week because of his cases of abuse.  He, however, said he prays for “good temperament” after the incident that led to the suspension of his radio station. Isah, popularly known as Ordinary president, hosts a radio and television programme known as “Brekete Family.” In a BBC Africa Eye documentary, the activist was seen slapping a lady who was accused of setting her brother’s daughter on fire over an allegation that she is a witch. Although Isah apologised for his action, the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) invited him to clarify the circumstances leading to the incident. The nation’s broadcasting governing body later suspended the licence of his radio station for 30 days — effective from May 31 for engaging in a “recurring unprofessional conduct.” In a Twitter post on Monday, Isah said: “No matter the good you do, pray for good temperament.” The broadcaster said he got into trouble because of “hot temper”, adding that he is a “learner” on the job. “Na hot temper put me for this trouble wey I dey so. I no dey hide mouth! Na learner I be!!”
