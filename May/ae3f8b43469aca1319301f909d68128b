The £4.2 million (over N2. 3 billion) recovered from a former governor of Delta State, James Ibori, by the United Kingdom government, has arrived Nigeria. A senior official in the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice told Leadership that the money arrived in the country on Tuesday morning. SaharaReporters Media According to the source, the £4.2 million was recovered from friends and family members of the former governor. The source said: ”The £4.2m seized from former Delta state governor, James Ibori, just arrived Nigeria this morning (Tuesday). The money was recovered from his friends and family members.” The money has been a subject of controversy, especially since the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), said the Federal Government would spend the money some of its projects, which are outside of Delta State. The Delta State government and some lawyers have criticised the AGF, saying it would be wrong for the Federal Government to spend money looted from the state on projects in other states.
