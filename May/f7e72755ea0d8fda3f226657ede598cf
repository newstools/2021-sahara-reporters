The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, who is currently being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over massive financial misappropriation, has run to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, after feigning sickness. SaharaReporters learnt that the EFCC had in October 2020, given Obasa back his passport to enable him get medical treatment, only for him to resurface in Mecca, hale and hearty.  SaharaReporters had on October 10, 2020, reported that Obasa was grilled by the EFCC after an emergency sitting of the state House of Assembly. To avoid answering questions surrounding his corrupt act, Obasa had feigned sickness during interrogation at the EFCC’s office. “Obasa became weak when confronted with a deluge of his illicit properties and money laundering evidence by the team led by an officer from the southeastern part of the country, contrary to his earlier claims of no links to the properties.

7 Months Ago “He became weak after hours of grilling by the vigilant and dogged staff of the EFCC. To escape sleeping at the EFCC office overnight and with the effect of the weight of evidence on his shoulder, Obasa claimed to be sick. He was then taken to the sickbay of the EFCC on the directive of the Zonal Head, for immediate treatment and was subsequently released on bail,” a source had said. SaharaReporters can confirm that Obasa also pleaded that his passport should be released to him so he could travel abroad for medical treatment. But it was all a ruse as the Lagos Speaker soon proceeded on Umrah (also called lesser Hajj or lesser pilgrimage) to meet with the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu in Saudi Arabia.
