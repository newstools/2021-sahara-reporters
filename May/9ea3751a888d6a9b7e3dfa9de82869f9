Governor Benedict Ayade of Cross River State has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ayade announced his decision moments ago at the Executive Council chambers of the Governor’s Office in Calabar.  CrossRiverWatch had earlier reported that the governor was in a meeting with APC chieftains, brewing suspicions of a likely defection. It was learnt that APC National Caretaker, Governor Mai Mala Buni; Governors Kayode Fayemi and Hope Uzodinma  of Ekiti and Imo states respectively as well as the Minister for State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, were among those said to be present.
