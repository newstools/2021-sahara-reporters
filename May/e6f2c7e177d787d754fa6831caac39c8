The major streets of Osogbo, Osun State have been occupied by civil society organisations protesting against insecurity and bad governance in Nigeria. The protest is aimed at sensitising residents of the state to always stand against injustice and maladministration rather than dying in silence, according to the convener, Comrade Waheed Lawal.  Waheed noted that despite the human and natural resources the country is endowed with, poor leadership has put the country in the wrong direction leading to untold hardship for the masses. SaharaReporters gathered that the protesters, who took off from the popular Freedom Park at Old Garage and marched through station road, urged shop owners around Fagbewesa junction to join the advocacy for better Nigeria.
