The police in Kwara State have said they repelled a reprisal on the command when some gunmen, suspected to be cultists, invaded the formation on Friday. The police spokesperson said the attack came after it had put a situation under control earlier around Surulere, Baboko and Oja Tuntun areas of the state capital. File photo used to illustrate story. He said two tricycles invaded the police headquarters in Ilorin, opening fire but they met resistance from the men and officers of the command. He said, “We had gone to put a situation under control this morning involving two cult groups and we made some arrests. “These boys mobilised themselves and began to attack the police because one of them jumped inside a canal in Surulere while trying to evade arrest. “We called the Fire Service to retrieve the body but the boys came to disrupt them but the police were able to retrieve the corpse from the cult guys later.” He, however, said the police had launched an investigation into the matter to unravel the mystery. There have been cases of cult groups clashes recently, especially in Ilorin, the state capital.
