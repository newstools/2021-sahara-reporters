According to him, Hisbah acted based on Section 403 of the Bauchi State law which empowers it to stop the sale and consumption of alcohol in the state. He said that the Hisbah command was committed and determined to ensure that the provisions of Sharia were fully implemented across the state and “without vindictiveness, witch-hunt, fear or favour.” Despite public condemnation, the destruction of beer and other alcoholic beverages by Hisbah has continued in some northern states. For instance, in November 2020, about 1,975 bottles of beer estimated at N200 million were confiscated and destroyed by the security outfit in Kano State. The agency established to enforce Sharia law in some states recently banned stylish haircuts, sagging of trousers, and playing of music at social events by disk jockeys. They have also been seizing tricycles from riders for adorning them with pictures considered to be obscene and against the tenents of Islam. Hisbah also banned commercial motorcycle and tricycle riders from carrying two women at a time. This was in addition to other unusual directives reeled out by the Islamic police.
