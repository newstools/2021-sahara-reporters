Former Nigerian President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, has said his former boss, the late President Musa Yar’Adua would always be remembered for being a peacekeeper. Jonathan stated this in a series of tweets on Wednesday, to mark the 11th year remembrance of Yar’Adua who died in 2010 while still in office as president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.  Yar’Adua died on May 5, 2010 at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa after battling an illness that kept him away from public eyes. He was buried on May 6 in Danmarna, Katsina State. Jonathan was serving as vice president of the country until he was sworn in on May 6 as president following the death of his predecessor as the Nigerian Constitution demands. Paying tribute on Wednesday to mark the anniversary of his death, Jonathan described his former boss as “a peacemaker, nation builder and democrat whose timeline was defined by virtues of service, peace, truth and love”. The statement reads: “Today, I celebrate my boss, friend, colleague and brother, President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua who departed this world 11 years ago. “As politicians, we shared a common vision of a peaceful, united and just nation. President Yar’Adua kept faith in this vision, channelling his strength and time in pursuit of an egalitarian society, until his last breath. “Although out of our sight, his legacies live with us and his memory we will continue to cherish. “We will always remember him as a peacemaker, nation builder and democrat whose timeline was defined by virtues of service, peace, truth and love.”
