A community in Obohia Amuda Isuochi in the Umunneochi Local Government Area of Abia State has banished a man identified as Obioma Ubani for 20 years. In a video that has now gone viral, Obioma is seen being escorted out of the community by members of the Obohia Development Union.  Obioma was accused of engaging in witchcraft and killing one Professor Chike Ubani through that means.He was adorned with raffia palms, popularly known as Omu while carrying along with him a nylon bag. A narrator in the video said, ”This is the man that was accused of killing Prof Chike Ubani of Umuahia, Umuneze. He and his wife have been banished for 20 years from the community."  In another scene, one of the community leaders warned the people not to assault Obioma. He was heard saying, “We have agreed that nobody will touch him, that was our decision." The people escorted him out of the community, singing what sounded like a dirge.
