The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) on Thursday warned against the any move by any group to introduce Sharia law to the South-West zone of the country through the ongoing constitutional review being carried out by the Senate. The Christian body warned the Senate not to succumb to any agitation from any quarters capable of plunging the country into a major religious crisis.  The President of the PFN, Bishop Francis Wale Oke, who stated this in an interview with reporters in Ibadan, Oyo State, said rather, the nation's lawmakers should direct their efforts towards solving the mounting problems bedevilling the country, especially as they concern the security of lives and property of the populace. "The problems confronting our nation are enormous than wanting to create more. Sharia law is alien to our culture of religious existence in the South-West. As such, nobody should through any subterfuge, bring it in so as to cause crisis," the body said. According to the body, the introduction of such a law in the South-West would pitch Christians against their Muslims counterparts. "We want to strongly warn the Senate and those behind this plan to unsettle the peace being enjoyed in this country, to desist before it's too late. Don't instigate religious crisis in the South-West; this could further threaten the fragile peace of the country," it further said.
