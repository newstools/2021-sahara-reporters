Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, has constituted a committee to conduct a safety audit of all Nigerian Air Force operational and engineering units. The development follows Friday's plane crash which claimed the lives of Nigeria's Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru and 10 other military officers.  The military officials were en route to the capital, Abuja, after making an official trip to Kaduna state. Also in February, seven Nigerian Air Force officers died in a plane crash. The men were in a Beechcraft King Air B350i which crashed at Bassa aviation village near Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, after their plane engine developed a fault. In a statement on Tuesday, the Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, stated that the Committee is made up of serving and retired officers. Their duties include: analysing safety reports from operational and engineering units, conducting safety evaluation of NAF units, and recommend measures to enhance the safety of operations in the units. Chaired by Air Vice Marshal Abraham Adole, the Deputy Theatre Commander, Operation HADIN KAI, the Committee is to submit its report not later than June 18.
