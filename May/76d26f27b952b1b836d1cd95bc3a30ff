The Imo State Police command says it has arrested five hoodlums who launched an attack on the reconstruction site of Orji Police Station which was burnt during #EndSARS protest last October. This was disclosed in a statement on Tuesday by the spokesman for the command, Bala Elkana.  According to him, the hoodlums sighted the re-establishment of a functional police station as a threat that may prevent them from carrying out their nefarious acts in the area, hence invaded the site. However, the State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, led an enforcement team to the scene after which five suspects namely Chigaemezu Sabastine, Casmir Ibe, John Chinonso, Chukwudi Okoro and Alozie Daberechi were arrested. The statement read, "On 25th May 2021 at about 1302hours, some hoodlums in their numbers launched an offensive on the reconstruction site of Orji Divisional Headquarters which was earlier burnt by hoodlums during the EndSARS protest in 2020. A philanthropist contracted the reconstruction project. "The hoodlums, who believed that re-establishment of a functional police station may prevent them from carrying out their nefarious acts in Orji and environs, decided to invade the construction site. "Before the arrival of reinforcement team, the hoodlums melted into the neighbouring township's area but abandoned their operational vehicles. The Commissioner of Police, Imo State, CP Abutu Yaro, fdc personally led an enforcement team to the scene." It said that "no life was lost". "Three vehicles were recovered," it added.
