The burial rites of the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru, and other senior officers who lost their lives in an air mishap in Kaduna on Friday will be held on Saturday in Abuja. The interment for the late COAS and six other senior officers will take place at the National Military Cemetery, Abuja, by 1 pm. Ibrahim Attahiru Burial proceedings will be held at the National Mosque and National Christian Centre, respectively. The army officers were killed on May 21, 2021, when their plane crashed near the Kaduna International Airport, an air force spokesman said. Attahiru was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari in January in a shakeup of the top military command to better fight surging violence and a more than decade-long jihadist insurgency. In a statement by his spokesman Femi Adesina, President Buhari commiserated with families of the deceased, the military, describing the dead military officers as “heroes who paid the ultimate price for peace and security in the land.” The Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, has directed that an Accident Investigation Board be constituted to unravel the immediate and remote cause of the crash. Irabor said the Armed Forces of Nigeria remains committed to combatting the security challenges bedevilling the nation. “The sacrifices of our dearly departed heroes will not be in vain," he said.
