Residents of Ogueka Community in the Uhunmwonde Local Government Area of Edo state have accused the state commissioner of police, Philip Ogbadu and the officer-in-charge of the anti-cultism unit of allegedly releasing an armed robbery suspect after a suit has been filed against him by the police.  SaharaReporters gathered that the suspect, Victor Osarentoe and one Esosa Douglas, were recently arrested by the police for armed robbery.  Different arms and ammunition were also recovered in the cause of the successful operation.  “The suspects also made confessional statements which prompted the police boss to give an order for the suspected armed robber and his cohort to be charged to court without much ado, the order of the commissioner was flouted by the OC in-charge of anti-cultism having been bribed by the allies of Victor Osarentoe who vowed to pervert justice and submitted that they have the police in Edo State Command at their back and call,” a resident told SaharaReporters.  He therefore called on the police boss and OC in-charge of anti-cultism to desist from engaging in any act capable of breaching peace and tranquility of the state.  He insisted that those indicted in the case should be charged to court inline with the suit already filed in a Benin High Court which is a court of competent jurisdiction to avoid breakdown of law and order in the community.
