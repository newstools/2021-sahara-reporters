Boko Haram fighters on Friday attacked the Operation Hadan Kai troops’ location in Rann in the Kala Balge Local Government Area of Borno State, with 10 of them shot dead during a fierce gun battle. This was hours into the resumption of the new Chief of Army Staff, Maj Gen Farouk Yahaya, at the Nigerian Army Headquarters, Abuja. File Photo Yahaya, the 22nd army chief, until his appointment, was the Theatre Commander of Operation Hadan Kai – the military operation which fights the decade-long insurgency in the North-East. SaharaReporters learnt that the terrorists invaded the town and subsequently military camp in several gun trucks as the casualties recorded had yet to be verified. The Director, Army Public Relations, Brig-Gen Mohammed Yerima, confirmed the attack, saying ten terrorists were killed. He was, however, silent on the casualties recorded by the troops. He said, “Barely hours into the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff Gen Faruk Yahaya, Boko Haram Terrorists attempted an audacious attack on troops of Operation Hadin Kai in Rann the Headquarters of Kala Balge LGA of Borno State. “The terrorists came in their numbers mounted on gun trucks and attempted to infiltrate the main entrance to the town. The highly spirited troops were right on hand to counter the move and inflicted a humiliating defeat on the terrorists who abandoned their evil mission and took to their heels. “The troops chased the retreating terrorist and ensured there was no further threat to the town and its residents. Troops successfully destroyed one of the gun trucks and recovered multiple weapons including one anti-aircraft gun, two machine guns and eight AK-47 rifles neutralising ten terrorists in the process.”
