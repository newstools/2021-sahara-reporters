The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has urged those clamouring for the creation of state police to think twice, saying it will only worsen the current situation.  Addressing his church members in Akure on Sunday, the clergyman said the governors would hijack the establishment of state police for their personal interests.  He also faulted the governors for coming out late with a series of solutions to tackle the nation’s challenges.  The cleric said: “They have waited too long, and I think the situation is already out of hand. Restructuring is late, state police are out of it.  “Conduct a poll today on what the Nigerian people want, they will tell you nothing, but disintegration.  “The president has clearly said it through his aides that he would not succumb to threats to restructure the country.  “The message simply means that the president doesn’t believe in restructuring and no amount of threats can change his mind.  “They want the citizens to continue to wallow in abject poverty; Do you think you can control my destiny?  “Responsible government does not wait for citizens to beg before doing what they want. Why do you think I should beg you for a job, electricity or good roads?  “Are you spending your personal money? The money you spend belongs to you and I. If you are unable to fix the country, then, you are nothing but a clown.  “Let me repeat myself again that Nigeria should be looking towards disintegration.”  His comment comes amid the specks of dust trailing the resolutions of governors in the South under the aegis of Southern Governors Forum during a recent meeting in Asaba, Delta State.  Among the decisions reached were the ban on open grazing in the South, restructuring of the country, respect for Federal Character, the sanctity of the unity of the country, state police and convocation of a national dialogue.
