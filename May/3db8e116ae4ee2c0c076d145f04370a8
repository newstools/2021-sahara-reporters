The Kano State Hisbah Board has dismissed one of its top officials allegedly found with a married woman in a hotel room in the Sabon Gari area of the state. The Hisbah Public Relations Officer, Lawal Fagge, confirmed the sacking of the official on Tuesday.  According to him, this was necessitated by the need to ensure transparency as well as guard against immortality. SaharaReporters had earlier reported how an official of the command, Sani Rimo, was allegedly found in a questionable position with a married woman, but the command told SaharaReporters that the woman in question is the daughter of the official.

2 Months Ago The matter became public when it featured on Freedom Radio's popular magazine programme “Inda Ranka”. Several reactions from different parts of the country trailed the news. Kano's Hisbah Commander, Muhammed Haruna, had described the incident as unfortunate, adding that a two-man committee had been set up to investigate the matter. It was discovered that before the incident, the official was said to be active at arresting prostitutes and others considered as going against the tenets of Islam. Hisbah officers regularly arrest unmarried people caught in hotels, presumably for sexual activities, as part of their enforcement of the Sharia. Established to enforce Sharia law, Hisbah recently banned stylish haircuts, sagging of trousers, playing of music at social events by disk jockeys and seized tricycles from riders for adorning them with pictures considered to be obscene and against the tenents of Islam in some states. Hisbah also banned commercial motorcyclists and tricycle riders from carrying two women at a time. This was in addition to other unusual directives reeled out by the Islamic police.
