The family members and relatives of the six people kidnapped by bandits, in the Tafa Local Government Area of Niger State are struggling to raise N24 million ransom demanded by their abductors.  Armed bandits have been terrorising the community going from house to house to kidnap residents.  About a week ago, six people were kidnapped and have yet to regain their freedom because the N24 million ransom the bandits demanded has not been raised.  The latest abduction happened on Monday at midnight where 15 people were whisked away by armed criminal elements.  The incessant abductions led to a protest by the angry youths who went on a rampage by 6:00 am on Monday and barricaded the busy road with bonfire, stones and wood, insisting that nobody would pass until the government addressed the issue of insecurity in the area.  One of the youths, Idris Beyioku told SaharaReporters on Monday night that the family members of the six people had not raised the N24 million ransom, and that it has created tension as to what could become the fate of the kidnapped loved ones.  Speaking on the latest kidnap of 15 community residents, he said their abductors had not contacted the family members to ask for ransom, as at the time of filing this report.  “They haven’t made contact yet with their families. They were abducted in their houses. The bandits go from house to house, and there is panic everywhere because we cannot sleep.  “Even the last abduction that occurred, the families of the six people kidnapped have not raised N24 million ransom demanded by the bandits. The families are still sourcing for the money,” Beyioku said.  Speaking on the steps taken by the security agents, he said, “The police are currently patrolling the streets but there is unrest everywhere. There are no vigilantes where the abduction happened because it’s a new site. This country is a big scam.” What is your brother Luli hey Siri
