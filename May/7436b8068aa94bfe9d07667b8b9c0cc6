Kaduna state governor, Nasir El-Rufai, says protests and strike action embarked upon by workers in the state will not alter plans to sack some of them. The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in the state had embarked on strike to protest against mass disengagement of workers and other alleged anti-labour moves by the government. Kaduna State Governor Nasiru Ahmed El-Rufai NLC National President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, said at the flag-off of the action on Monday that it would run its full course unless the state government attended to the workers grievances. El-Rufai on his verified Facebook page however insisted that the government would not be intimidated by the strike to shelve its plan to rightsize its workforce. He said, “Kaduna State Government affirms that the conditions that compel it to rightsize are not altered by the NLC’s campaign of economic and social sabotage.
