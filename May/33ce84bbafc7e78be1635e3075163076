The Supreme Court on Friday described the dissolution of local governments in Oyo State as illegal. The apex court in the country also ruled that their replacement with caretaker committees is illegal.  The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Justice Abubakar Malami (SAN) had earlier directed the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde to reverse himself over the dissolution of local government administration in the state. The directive was contained in a letter to the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Oyo State, Prof. Oyewo Oyelowo dated 14 January 2020. The letter, marked HAGF/OYO/2020/Vol.I/I, was entitled, “Unconstitutionality of dissolution of elected local government councils and appointment of caretaker committee: the urgent need for compliance with extant judicial decisions”. The AGF said, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court on the matter that is binding on all 36 states of the Federation, “the common practice by some state governors in dissolving elected local government councils is unconstitutional, null and void.”
