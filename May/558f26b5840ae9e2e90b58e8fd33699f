Delta state governor Ifeanyi Okowa According to the former information commissioner, the dissolution was aimed at bringing on board fresh blood that will join hands with the governor to achieve his agenda of a stronger Delta. "The governor thanked and commended members of the dissolved cabinet for their contributions to the successes of his administration in the past six years including those who joined in last two years. The governor also directed that all the affected former appointees to hand over to the permanent secretaries in their respective Ministries," he said. Aniagwu stated that before the state Exco dissolution, the sum of N2.8 billion for the purchase and upgrade of facilities at the recently established three universities in the state was approved by it as well as the dismissal of one Bernard Onomugo from the state civil service over alleged smuggling of names into the state payroll. Our correspondent reliably gathered that the dissolution of the state executive council by the state governor was not unconnected to the 2023 general elections as most of his cabinet members and appointees were already heating up the polity.
