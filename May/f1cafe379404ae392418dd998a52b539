Senior Shepherd of the Household of God Church International Ministries, Lagos, Rev Chris Okotie has offered two solutions to salvage Nigeria from its current crises. The pastor said restructuring of the country to accommodate fiscal federalism and a total replacement of 1999 Constitution are the two remedies to save the most populous black nation on earth.  He, however, said that Nigeria will experience rebirth after a major crisis The cleric stated this in a statement titled, ‘Major Crisis Imminent, Okotie Warns.' “Nigeria is at the cusp of a major crisis which is a precursor to its rebirth. “Pristine forces which have been a perennial impediment to the fulfilment of Nigeria’s prophetic destiny are about to be pulverized,” the statement partly read. Okotie also called for more practical measures against the spread of violence in the country. The cleric, “identified the parlous state of the economy, corruption and endemic poverty as the root causes of the nation’s security crisis.” He boldly “supports the calls for restructuring as one of the key solutions to the problems of nationalities, inequality and ethnic divisions that inhibit national cohesion." According to him, “the battle between centripetal and centrifugal forces would continue to fuel instability, unless the constitution is changed to reflect national diversity.”
