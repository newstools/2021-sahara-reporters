In what appears like an afterthought, the Nigerian government has finally flown the national flags hoisted at the popular 'Eagle Square' at half mast after a report by SaharaReporters. SaharaReporters had on Monday published a report, video and pictures of how the government ignored its own directive for public buildings, facilities and official residences to fly the national flags at half mast from Monday, May 24 to Wednesday, May 26th.  Checks on Wednesday by our correspondent showed the flags were flown at half mast in compliance with the directive to honour the army officers who lost their lives in a plane crash on Friday in Kaduna.  It was gathered that SaharaReporters' report embarrassed some top government officials, Federal Capital Territory Authority (FCTA), and authority in charge of the facility. It has also embarrassed the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government, SaharaReporters gathered. See Also

2 Days Ago Eagle Square was constructed in 1999 to serve as the platform for the official take-off of the Fourth Republic of the Federation of Nigeria. It was flancked on both sides by the Federal Secretariat, National Cenotaph,  National Assembly Complex, and the Supreme Court. It has since then provided the primary arena for the symbolic transfer of power and inauguration of a new government, notably the swearing-in ceremony of the President of Nigeria.
