A former Judge of the Enugu State High Court, Justice Stanley Nnaji, has been shot dead by unknown gunmen. The Enugu State Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Aliyu has ordered a manhunt for the armed assailants who killed the judge.  The incident was captured in a video posted on Twitter by The Nigerian Barrister @TheNigerianBar. The video shows armed men dragging Nnaji out of his car at a deserted crossroad.

The video also shows some cars a distance away from the judge’s car – all not moving as the incident unfolded. The video, filmed by a resident overlooking the road, has the voice of the recorder. In a statement by the spokesperson for the Police Command, Daniel Ndukwe, the Commissioner stated that the victim was rushed to the hospital, where he was confirmed dead by doctors on duty and deposited in the mortuary for autopsy, adding that the incident took place at about “1700 hrs.” Meanwhile, the Commissioner, while assuring that no stone would be left unturned in fishing out perpetrators of the heinous crime, called on residents of the state to remain law-abiding, vigilant and assist the police with useful information that will lead to the arrest and prosecution of the assailants. Justice Nnaji was a Judge of the Enugu State High Court until he was dismissed following his role in the removal of Governor Chris Ngige, the then Governor of Anambra State in 2007 via a questionable ex-parte order. His killing comes hours after the former Special Adviser on Politics to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Ahmed Gulak, was shot dead by gunmen in Owerri, Imo State. Gulak was on his way to Abuja from Owerri when he was killed Saturday night.
