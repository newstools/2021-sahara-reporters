Five military men have been killed in Ihiala, Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State, by people suspected to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra. According to Daily Trust, the military personnel were killed in the early hours of Saturday.  Consequently, military personnel blocked the River Niger Bridgehead, Onitsha, obstructing traffic flow in and out of the state due to eyewitnesses. The eyewitness, however, said the military later opened the bridge for traffic to flow at about noon on Saturday. Meanwhile, newspaper vendors in Awka have decried the stoppage of vehicles conveying newspapers from Lagos to the state at the bridgehead. Miss Nneka Okoye, a vendor at Aroma junction, Awka said the situation had disrupted their business for the day. “We are surprised to face this kind of problem this morning. As you can see, there is no Saturday paper on display here now. “The distributors told us that the vehicles carrying newspapers were stopped at Bridgehead, Onitsha because of issues the military had with people at Ihiala,” Okoye said. Apart from vehicles carrying newspapers, others were equally blocked from moving in and out of Onitsha in the early hours of today. When contacted, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Anambra State Command, said that the early morning gridlock at the head bridge resulted from stringent checks by security operatives there. According to Ikenga, the measure was meant to track bad elements.
