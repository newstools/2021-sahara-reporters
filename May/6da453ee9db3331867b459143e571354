The police officer who died after a grenade on his waist mistakenly exploded has been identified as Inspector Idi Amin. There had been reports that there was an explosion opposite Amizi Amangbala Primary School in Afikpo North when a suicide bomber blew up himself.  The area was reportedly thrown into panic as passersby scampered for safety. But the Ebonyi state police command has said that the man killed in an explosion on Tuesday in the Afikpo area of the State is a policeman and not a suicide bomber as claimed by many. Spokesperson for the police in Ebonyi state, Loveth Odah said the victim of the blast was a Mobile Police Officer on special deployment to Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. The police Inspector identified as Idi Aminu reportedly died as a result of an accidental hand grenade explosion.  Odah who said the police officer was an operative of MOPOL 32 and not a suicide bomber as claimed by many, mistakenly hit the lead of his grenade which was hanging on his waist. She said, “He mistakenly hit the lead of his grenade which was hanging on his waist with his elbow resulting in the deadly explosion. So, there is no bomb blast or explosion in Ebonyi. The general public should disregard the information." His remains have been evacuated to a mortuary.
